As of May 2013, this attractions is open for the public 2:00 PM-5:00 PM (at least on Saturdays). This is contrary to previous information stating it was 10:00 AM-5:00 PM. I was unable to find another attraction in the area for visiting in the meantime, so I missed it.

Atlantic rainforest at its very best. Second, perhaps, only to some places in Rio de Janeiro state, and at a great advantage due to the Serra Verde Express railway (sit on the left!), Morretes and the adjacent state park are gems that visitors to Paraná mustn't miss.

The Linha Tourismo bus stops here so you can hop off and check this out. There was quite a lineup when we went on a Sunday afternoon. I'm not sure if that is usual. The elevator only holds about 4-6 people so it takes a while to get in and go up. Once you're up though you could spend some time up in the tower. There is amazing views of Curitiba and lots of room to move around comfortably. There is also a telephone museum on the main level as well as a small selection of souvenir items.

It's another ""must see"" if you like panoramic views and/or understanding the town's architecture.

Unfortunately, the place looks like it has been abondaned many years ago. There is a center of touristic information at the entrance, but when I've visited it was closed (friday morning around 10am). Inside the place there isn't a guide explaining about the attraction and each floor is completely empty!

We learned a lot but were unable to find any machines. We thought there may be more of a museum on the inside but only found a cinema.

Theres a small cafe attached to the cinema that made us a tasty cold coffee drink with ice cream. Id recommend checking it out.

The ""Oi"" communications tower rises nearly a hundred meters above Curitiba.

Take the time to venture to the GasWorks in Porto Alegre. It is like an outdoor mall, with vendors offering cheap food, souvenirs, and drink - the hot mulled wine was my favorite. As the sun goes down, climb the stairs inside the restored gasworks factory to see the exhibits there. Looking out over the water, you can see the night lights strung across the mall and enjoy the evening breeze. When I was there, several sculptures were on display at the roof level. Free admission and local flavor were two more advantages to this memorable attraction.

Well, there's really not much to this, ultimately, but it was a really fun place to go to see the sunset and just be part of a crowd. We ate crepes on sticks AND churros, (I had clearly lost my mind,) we listened to a great band, we enjoyed just wandering through all the food stalls, we watched the sunset and took great photos, we climbed the stairs and had a look out over the city.

We recently visited the Oi Panoramic Tower located in the Merces area of Curitiba. We were fortunate to go on a clear, sunny day. You can reach the attraction by walking from other places in the city ( a 45-minute walk from Centro) or by the green tour bus that visits all the main tourist points in Curitiba. The entrance fee to visit the tower is R$3.50 each. <br> It takes about a minute or so to reach the top of the tower in an elevator that holds six people. When you enter the top, you will get to see all the main points of this large southern Brazilian city. The views are excellent in all directions. You can also see the beautiful Serra do Mar mountains in the distant background. My only recommendation is that you bring a good camera with you for high-quality pictures. A small digital camera is good but a professional camera will produce some really nice pictures for you. This is the best place in the city to get a great view of the many buildings (Clock building, Bristol hotel, Palacio Iguacu, Italia building) that are found in Curitiba. You also get a picture-perfect view of Barigui Park, Curitiba's most beautiful and spacious park.

From the top of the tower a 180 degree panoramic view of the entire city and the further outskirts and Serra do Mar mountain range. Conveniently located at Merces area, it can reached either by walking from downtown - some 40 minutes walking - or by the sightseeing double-deck bus, given the tower is one of the attractions. The best is to visit with a clear-sky day. Fall days are by far the best as the cobalt blue skybathe the landscape and view with an amazing light.

I'm a fan of looking at cities from great heights. This tower offers this possibility. Although at cloudy weather you will not have a really impressive view.

The most important thing you should know about Usina Do Gasômetro is that it´s not only a cultural center, you gotta take advantage of the entire complex. People who live in Porto Alegre usually reffer (or refer?) to ""Gasômetro"" as the whole Rio Guaiba´s shore. <br><br>First of all, prefer to visit it in the morning, specially in the weekends, when the place gets ""too popular"", and you may find some trouble with pickpockets, in the morning is preocupation free. The place is awesome, and the chosen one Porto Alegrense elected for jogging and running due to the amazing view and ""beach sensation"" it has.<br><br>Unfortunately the facilities are restricted, its hard to find WCs and places to eat and drink, only a few dirty tents selling drinks and dangerous food.<br><br>The mayor is now taking a major refurb in the place for the soccer World Cup (since the place is very near to Beira Rio Stadium), and promises to be one of the most beautiful places in the country.<br><br>My suggestion, go to Usina do Gasometro near to 10:00 am for a bike riding (theres Samba bikes for renting) you just need to get the app for your mobile phone to release them. Take a ride in south direction to see the beautiful Marinha do Brasil Park (Brasil´s Navy Park), and after Beira Rio Stadium, the place wich is hosting next Soccer World Cup, just in front of the stadium, in the very same side of the street you are going to be biking, theres one of the most delicious places to eat the traditional barbecue, the price is high, about R$ 50,00 per person, but it worth. After the heavy food take a rest at Parque Gigante (the place where the restaurant is located) and return the same way biking.<br><br>Additionaly theres some four place bike to carry your child in the weekends, it´s kind of fun for the litlle ones.

The Oi Panoramic Tower has views all over Curitiba. I walked to the lift, inside of which an attendant was sitting.

It's a 'hours councours' area for cultural activities in Porto Alegre city. Yet, the years goes by and the maintenance seems to be at a minimal value. Every now and then when I go visit the area, specially when it's not hosting any major activity, it seems to have much more patching, leaks and poor infrastructural maintenance.

In Brazil I went to a few places where you can see the city from a panoramic view, this included Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, however with this one, I found myself not very interested once I got to the top. You have to pay (I can't remember how much) and the que took about 1 hour to get through, so my boredom may have been part of the long wait. Also, because there are glass windows at the top, you cant appreciate the view fully or take photos because there are hand smudges on all of the windows. Worth a try though if its not busy!

We stopped in this winery on a whim, and ended up spending quite a bit of time, and surprisingly little money, considering what we came out with. We are ordinarily unimpressed with Brazilian wines, and were very pleasantly surprised to stumble upon this gem of a place where people offered us samples of very pleasantly drinkable local wine on all sides. They also carry quite a variety of quality food gift items and boxed assortments, at what seem to be right around or just below local grocery store prices. Highly recommended!

I went there on a Wednesday afternoon, right after lunch, and I was quite disappointed. Granted, it was not high season or a particularly busy time of day, but that would be a good reason to provide excellent service, I think. The salespeople were distracted, chatting among themselves and didn't seem to notice me and my two friends walking around. We were not offered any tries - people told me they are famous for them. One of my friends asked if he could try some of the wine, and only then they provided it. It just felt like some sad market around the corner. Very disappointing. I give it two stars because the chocolates actually tasted good after I bought them.

This museum, located just a couple of minutes by foot from the Teatro São Pedro, could be described as ""anachronic"" - it features a variegated collection of objects and pieces of art that span a quite large period of the state's modern history. Some items are indeed burlesque, as the ""Giant's Boot"", an enormous shoe legend says was used by someone with a really bad case of giantism. I would not recommend to go to the area exclusively for this, but once one is already at the theatre at the other side of the park, why not?

Compared with the surrounding (busy roads, tower blocks etc) it is different and a mini oasis i suppose, but very small with very few seats - you can walk across it in less than 1 minute walking slowly. It is definitely not worth travelling to just for this. It also usually has a few people walking with yapping dogs which does detract from the limited tranquility it offers.

This is a really great place to visit, very beautiful. Its a bit different to other gardens we had visited in South America. We even saw a photoshoot occurring among the roses, there were a few models around and plenty of cameras. This didn't even take from the garden as there was still plenty of space to avoid the photoshoot if you wanted and enjoy the plants.

Hello everyone. Good Morning, i would like to discuss about the ESTACAO shopping mall. Its is one of the best place to visit in your trip in Curitiba. So please don't miss to visit the mall and don't forget to have fun there with Family.... Awesome trip i had in January 2016 with my girlfriend. She is from Uruguay and i am from India, my girlfriend put more effort by selecting the places where me and she can have fun. First of all its very safe to go there. I met many Indians also there.

IT's a nice mall centrally loacted in a biulding made in the image of a train station, or was the old train station, I'm not 100 % what the taxi driver said. The mall is clean and well stocked with a lot of brands, the prices are not cheap, but it's a nice distraction if the weather is bad.

When I decided to go to Brazil, I was hoping to escape Black Friday, but it turns out that Brazil has a Black Friday too. :( <br>Because of the high taxes on imports, it's Black Friday can never be like the one here in United States where prices can be so low that people fight over flatscreen TVs, but they try in Brazil. <br><br>Anyway, it's a nice Mall. I just wish that the vendors would've done some English fact-checking before naming the business after an English name. There's a restaurant called ""Quickies"" and the first thing I thought, as a gringo, was the informal, sexual definition of it. And ""China Food"" is just grammatically incorrect.

I loved this mall, build in a former railway station, amazing architecture, they kept lots of the railway flair, especially in the food court. Negative points: accoustically very noisy... the whole gabble... If you get there by car, let somebody guide you. I was driving around and around until i found the only way to get in. Curitiba´s traffic is very ptactical for insiders but as a stranger you don´t get it right until you´re here for a few days.

This little museum was not design as such, but to be a casino. The building was design back in the 40s when the whole Pampulha complex was design by the most famous Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, then at the beginning of his career. The area around the MAP (Museu de Arte da Pampulha) is very agreeable, close to the lake Pampulha, with some fauna to admire around the building, it has interesting sculptures in the garden and those were design for Burle Marx, one of the most acclaimed Brazilian landscape designers.<br><br>In my opinion it was nice to do something useful with the building, although even after a renovation in the 90s it is possible to recognise that it was not planned as an art museum. Even dough, it is worth a visit, because the museum has an interesting collection of Brazilian contemporary art. Most big names of Brazilian artists such as Di Cavalcanti, Guinnard, Ibere Camargo, Tomie Ohtake, Volpi and many others area there.<br><br>One of my favourites, besides Di Cavalcanti is Vik Muniz, which has in the museum paintings that he did using chocolate. Not only for that, I like his art. He is quite creative and re-invent himself constantly, producing new different style of art works. It was nice to see closely his work on chocolate.

The museum is located on the banks of the pond pampulha. The building was designed by Oscar Niemeyer, world famous brazilian architect and, hosts some works and many mural projects from Paulo Werneck. Paulo Paulo Werneck was important for its colorful murals whose gave life and movement to the modernist constructions unison. It was also responsible for mosaic designs used in some famous buildings in Brazil. Unfortunately the information on his life and work is only in Portuguese. Visit applies to relax.

Such a nice museum, such poor use of it. The space was designed by Niemeyer as part of Pampulha and it was originally intended to be a casino.

We made a special trip to visit the museum only to find that it was closed due to a private function. Not that there would have been much to see – there didn’t seem to be any art or exhibitions inside. It appears that exhibitions are held sporadically.

A surprisingly lovely museum, with a series of rooms devoted to different aspects of the city's history - nature, work, carnival, religion, prostitution, people - and so on. Very imaginatively laid out, with much information also in English. The colonial house itself is very beautiful, and the shady garden around it, with a tram, a locomotive, statues, and so on, is a lovely place to sit. Next door is a modern exhibition space with (on our visit) a very imaginative and visually striking exhibition of Belo Horizonte theatre. On the second floor of that building is a small but very good open library with information about Minas Gerais and Belo Horizonte in open stacks. <br>The theme of the whole museum space is the reclamation of communal urban spaces and the protection of communal life. The excellent photographic material shows this in a very moving way - brilliant photographs of carnival, political demonstrations, shoe-cleaning, market stalls, and masses of human existence in public spaces. Free entry, just outside the centre, and absolutely worth it for a sense of the human space beneath this city.<br>The photographs of demonstrations in the lower space - from the anti-dictatorship demonstrations filling the centre of the city in 1984 to older feminist demonstrations and the recent happenings in the station square, are particularly great.

At the entrance you're greeted by an area of formal French gardens that lead to a greenhouse that is said to resemble the Crystal Palace in England. There is also a walking path through the grounds that take you past an extensive collection of plants that are native to Brazil in general or to the state of Parana in particular. There is a foot bridge that will take you over a small lake that is populated by large fish, turtles, ducks, and a heron. The bridge takes you to the museum where they have many plants for sale, including a wide variety of orchids. In addition, there is a 200 meter path that is advertised as a sensory experience. It's well worth a visit for the beauty of the gardens, and it's free!

This is one of the buildings designed by Oscar Niemeyer, the most famous Brazilian architect,while yet at the beginning of his career, for the complex of Pampulha, in Belo Horizonte.<br><br>This place was inaugurated in 1943 a ball room and restaurant that easily became popular among the local society. It suffered with different economic situations and it was closed sometimes as well as having different functions, as for instance annex of the art museum or restaurant in the 80s. Nowadays is preserved as a space for art exhibitions and it has a small auditorium.<br><br>When I visited, it had a colourful interactive installation with T-shirts that you could wear and in doing that you take part in the art; and a kind of cabin where you have distorted images of yourself. In the auditorium it was shown a bit of the history of the Pampulha complex and its architectonic importance in Brazilian scenery.<br><br>I enjoyed the visit.

Go there to watch the sunset in a beautiful day and take someone special. For a few minutes the world surrounding you is totally forgotten - and you wish it'd last forever.<br>It's all about being at a nice place with someone you love. <br>If you intend to ride at the rollercoster, prepare to pay R$7 each person for 15-20 minutes, about two or three times at the top (it was the price in December, 2014, last time I was there)<br>I cannot tell you guys about the rest of the park - every time I go there, I go straight to the rollercoster!

I like zoos, and this is good and big one. Actually, I don't understand how someone can say it is small (maybe they just didn't see all of it?): if you want to see everything, it can be hard to do it in a single day.<br>First, the animals, of course. It is quite complete, with a lot of species from Asia, Europe, America (specially Brazil, of course) and a LOT of African animals - and I'm talking the big ones here: elephants, lions, rhinos, hippos, giraffes. The reptile house is small but has some remarkable animals (like a python) and there's a butterfly garden as well. The sad part (for now) is that the big hit of the zoo, the gorilla Idi Amin (for a long time the most isolated animal in the world with the nearest gorilla in Mexico) has died. Still, there are 2 female gorillas now and they have a world class habitat space.<br>Second, the plants. Trees and flowers everywhere. It is a zoo-botanic foundation after all, so if you're not really into the animals, you can still enjoy this part.<br>Now for the problems: it can be confusing (not enough signs for its size) and it lacks some infrastructure (sometimes you'll find yourself walking on grass or dirt to get where you want). Also, it can e packed on the free days - it is not expansive and your money goes to animal/tree related research, do yourself a favor and go in a regular day. I'd say that it is a good option to bring your own food too.

This is a lovely place to spend a few hours near to Pampulha. There are regular buses from the centre of Belo Horizonte, which take about 45 minutes; otherwise the whole place is accessible by car. On the West side are botanical gardens, including some greenhouses focussing on Brazilian biomes (caatinga, cerrado); a bromeliad house, and displays of palms, cacti etc. There are pleasant green spaces where you can take and eat a picnic. The zoo is on the east side, up through very pleasant open forest. It has a good selection of the 'main' international animals (tigers, lions, gorillas (with young), elephants, a suprisingly tame rhinoceros, hippos, a rather mournful chimpanzee whose mate has died, monkeys and so on. They are very well kept and healthy and easy to see. There is also a good collection of Brazilian mammals, a very good collection of Brazilian birds, a reptile house, a butterfly space, an aquarium (which costs another 6 reais),<br>The zoo is spread out through the park, the park itself being a really pleasant part of the day. Like many state-supported amenities in Brazil, there are some bits which need some TLC (the restaurant complex has bits falling off); but there is also restoration going (very well-restored aviaries for example, and the Japanese garden). And unlike some of the previous reviewers, we thought that the food was very good, and good value - although there is also nothing to stop you joining the very many people picnicking.<br>While we were there, we overheard a discussion between a family and a guard. There are, it seems, rumours, that the place will be closed down and a shopping mall built instead. That would be incredibly sad. This is a very well-presented zoo, priced extremely reasonably (5 reais for an adult), and it is extremely well used by people from the city and its North-West suburbs, bringing their families and their children for a day in the open air away from the facelessness of the Mall. Let us hope that this amenity remains open for people who want to use it.

I have to say I was a little underwhelmed by it. I'd heard lots of people saying it's one of the gems of the city. Had we not used it as one of the stops on the curta bus, I would have been a bit annoyed travelling there. Nevertheless, it is a nice way to escape the city and experience a wide variety of beautiful plants. I'm sure if you enjoy plants and flora you would love it, as they are all well labeled and presented

Drove by it the other day and admired the newly scrubbed and redecorated 1930s/1940s facade. Haven't been inside, at least not yet. An article in the Estado de Minas this week raves about the work that has been done to revive the place to its former glory and, if I understand correctly, re-purpose it for a variety of entertainment functions and activities. In-person, the outside looks lively, festive and great. From pictures, the interior looks sumptuous and beautiful. In sum, seems to me like renewal of a downtown architectural gem that's met all its design and planning objectives, and beyond that prepares the facility for audiences to enjoy for decades to come.

Niemeyer is this building's architect's name: Oscar Niemeyer was one of the most talented and famous brazilian architects of all times. Brasília, the country's capital, was built according his designs in the 60s and brings all the curves and sophistication this professional applied all over his projects (cities, furniture, buildings and urban landscapes). This one is, curiously, a residential building still in use. It has an urban and unique appeal and gathers a lot of modern and contemporary graphic artists, art professionals and interesting people of all kinds into its units. This building is set in the Praça da Liberdade surroundings (Liberty Square), another charming and absolutely lovely place to visit. The square is public, naturally, but the building, being a residential one, is access-controlled.

This is an unmistakable work of art given to all of us by Niemeyer, the great architect.<br>The building is an residential building with 2 apartments per floor. On each floor there is a 2 bedroom apartment and a 3 bedroom apartment. For what I heard the apartment are hard to be decorated and organized, because of the curves. The building is from the 60's or beginning of the 70's, and it doesn't get old. It belongs everywhere and anywhere. It was built amongst old classic buildings, and somehow it doesn't clash with them. Thank you Niemeyer.

We had read before that this was supposed to be one of the best botanical gardens in Brazil and it was the main reason why we came to Curitiba at all during our trip to Southern Brazil. Well, this is no more than a park, you could hardly call this a Botanical Garden!! There was no info material, no descriptions, no guided tours, and especially there are few trees or plantations of any kinds of flowers or plants whatsoever. And it was a lot smaller than we expected, too, including the ""Crystal Palace""-type greenhouse which was so small and unspectacular that any European garden centre would easily beat it hands down. A total disappointment!!!

And to make it even better Belo Horizonte was playing against a team from Rio - and the home team won! Went an hour early to enjoy the street parties. No beer is sold in the stadium but it looks like everyone had their fill beforehand. We were in a group of 15 - and all wore team colors which seemed like a really good idea until we realized that about 15,000 other people were as well. Made it kind of hard to keep track of each other while in the throngs outside!

This is a stadium that is located closer to downtown. It is smaller than the Mineirao and it is used by the one of the most important soccer teams in the city. The venue is also used as a music venue where Madonna and other big wigs played. I can't recommend the visit unless for a soccer game night. Do not your car there, grab a cab not the bus.

If you are a soccer fan, this is the place to go. Near everything, comfortable (food is OK - junk food mostly, but this is a soccer stadium ) lots of fun! It is small soccer stadium so you get a good chance to see everything but, of course, it all depends on who's playing on the day. Lots of taxi cabs to get back to where you re staying. Don't miss it if you enjoy soccer. Reasonable priced.

Never go on holidays or during the weekends. <br>On monday mornings is also no good, due to the trash left by sunday users.<br>Is the right place to wear yours sneakers for a walk. Then you relax ( if you are clever take a bottle of wine , an opener and some asppetizers - the canteen is weak), find yourself a piece of grass on a small hill and toast the sunset.<br>There are fishes and plenty of turtles inside both lakes (you might also seat by the lake) and enjoy the nature.<br>They don't allawd pets or cycles or rollers or balls.

This was for me the best part of Curitiba. Generally, I was not very impressed with the city, it's all about concrete and tall constructions, not necessarily the green image advertised. However, the botanical garden is great, a true oasis considering the surrounding landscape. Plus, the city bus tour stops in front of the entrance and you can catch the next one after you're done visiting to go to the other attractions.

Perhaps the most beautiful park in Curitiba. Better visit it during weekdays, for it gets really crowded on weekends. Take your camera and a bottle of water, and wear comfortable walking shoes.

Mineirão has a museum you can visit if no games are going on, and tours. Arena independência is a much smaller stadium, you should visit it just to watch a game, but it's a completely different experience: It's in the middle of a residential area where people hang around pre-game, and your view of the game will be much better than what you will get on mineirão (1/3 of the capacity will make it less exciting, though).<br><br>No seats have bad views, so you don't have to worry about that.

It's true, there isn't ""much"" to do here, but it was so nice to just walk around outside and watch the people. They have a little museum that talks about a famous biologist (if I am not mistaken) next to a little pond where you can see the fish swimming around and eating what visitors throw them. Inside the white structure is kind of crowded but it's neat to walk through. they have vendors selling treats and trinkets during the summer time.

The space seems a bit empty to me, and is centered around the main arboretum, which has 2 levels that you can walk up to check everything out. A few fountains and manicured flower beds lead you up to the arboretum. Somehow I expected it to be more like the US Botanical Gardens in Washington, DC. I will say, however, that the gardens do a brisk international business of digitizing and identifying plants - we saw some of that work going on, and it's quite impressive.

From a distance in a fine sunset this edificio might look great as a fine example of Oscar's engineering finesse, but close up on an average day it's a wreck.

I am surprised to read so negative comments about this park.<br>I find it rather charming and well located in the center of the city.<br>Very exotic birds, colourful, cute.<br>And you can see garça at the top of the trees,free, there are so elegant birds (heron).<br>You can rent a boat for 10 Reais ( 4 USD) or a bike for 2 Reais per hour.<br>There is even a small place for gym (for free).<br>If you consider you are in latin America I find this park quite interesting, not dirty and worth to visit.<br>Yes there are a few homeless people inside but not bothering.<br>Of course you have to walk there during the day as the center of Curitiba is not very safe at night.<br>Don't miss it : for kids and adults.

Some of us a little worse for wear in our day in Curitiba so taking it easy looking for shops and having a drinking in the historical centre we stumbled through this park. What a find, multiple aviaries of stunning birds, a lake with cheap cafe on it (4.50 a large beer) and pedalos for hire (10 reais per boat). Highly recommended for a free light trip from the center of town.

The zoo is free, its quite nice, since its free but the rest of the park is terrible. The park itself isn't terrible, but it is filled with beggars, drug addicts, hiv+ hookers and people up to no good. Police seems to be patrolling here as a pure necessity. There are pedalo boats, but I would not use them ever because if you fall in the water you might contract a disease with all the bum using it as a public toilet. <br>If you are the stereotype tourist, do not visit this place, you might get robbed. The surrounding are very sketchy during the day and even worse at night, to avoid at all cost.

The park isn't an amazing park, it is very beautiful but a normal Botanical Garden. Inside the dome is kind of a let down, I was expecting more exotic plants but there were normal trees....

If you only have one day in Curitiba I would say go to the Oscar Niemeyer Museum, then Santa Felicidade(a neighborhood with amazing, inexpensive wine- you will NOT miss the huge wine tasting house to the left when youre on the main road in, Av Manoel Ribas), and then the Gardens.

The garden space has some beautifully designed gardens with unique artistic structures.

It is a lovely well kept park where you can rent a bike or just chill under the trees, take a walk and watch the many beautiful birds that are everywhere. It is very sad though that the birds in the small ""zoo"" are confined to such small cages. It was really painful to watch so I can't give many details, they seem to be well taken care of though, unlike other places in Brazil that keep confined animals, but since they're birds I would have expected a bigger place. I didn't know there would be animals there, but apparently that was the first zoo of the city.

The gardens are quite nice, and are actually larger than they first appeared. I noticed several people view the greenhouse and then leave, thinking that was it.

A beautiful park, with an extension and an integral part beautiful. Exotic animals are found within the park, along with Lake and academia for the elderly.

French-style gardens, with paths appropriate to walk or jog. It gets quite crowded on Sundays and holidays. Well maintained, but few food options (few means one).

The Passeio Publico is an anachronic remembering of the 1880`s burguesy arose just encraved in a modern huge city. Just the old trees could be atractive.

I live four blocks from this park in Curitiba. There are several issues I have with the park. One, the walkways and paved running areas are too narrow and it is frustrating to try to jog in a park with little room to move. Second, there is a contingent of homeless people in the park and it is very obvious in the daytime. The park in some parts has a bad smell as well. A third thing of this park that I don't like is safety. Back in March, my girlfriend and I noticed a man with a weapon trying to rob an individual on a bicycle. There is a Policia Militar (police) presence in the park near the entrance but they are on one side of the park. I recommend Parque Barigui on the other city of Curitiba as a better and safer option.

A large botanical garden in classical Portuguese style with diagonal paths dividing the ornamental part of the garden; colourful border plantings are set on slightly raised flowerbeds to give a better effect.

I took the tour by touch and smell and listening with the blindfold on, following the handrail as I walked around the gardens at a painfully slow pace, smelling and feeling my way as I stumbled along. Later we walked along the pond where we stared down at hundreds of carp and turtles. There were also lots of healthy pigeons on hand, none of these ""Pombas Atomicas""--pomba atomica means ""atomic pigeon"" in English translated from Portuguese--one sees in all of the city parks and squares.

Though not a true ""botanical garden"", because there are exotic species planted there, the Jardim Botanico de Curitiba should be on everyone´s itinerary when visiting Curitiba. I make a point of taking all my guests because itis both immensely beautiful and there´s a story which goes with it. Part of pioneering mayor Jaime Lerner´s long legacy, the park was once a favela (shanty town). Where were these people sent? I´ll let you did deeper into that... Meanwhile the park is home to the iconic greenhouse, the french-inspired hedgerows, the japanese cherry blossom walk, the scented plant walk (which you can follow blind-folded if you like), and the visitor center that houses the Municipal Botanical collection, Brazil´s third largest botanical collection with active research underway. The Gardens are also an important venue for locals who use the park for recreation, including running, cycling (only in the velodrome), soccer and beach volleyball.

This is one of the nicest attractions in Curitiba. I highly recommend this botanic park/nature area for families. The main area of the park is the glass structure that houses botanic life. It is a great place for picture-taking. The children will love the small hills that are found in the park as they like to roll down the hills for fun. The park also has a small snack area that is usually crowded on weekends. If you don't want to be around the crowded snack bar, you can buy drinks as there is a vendor near the exit of the park.<br> Jardim Botanico also has a long wood walking plank above a lake that has a small museum that features stories about the people responsible for protecting wildlife and nature. There are pictures of animals and displays in the museum. It is a good testament to Curitiba being ""the most environmental city in Curitiba. Even if you are not keen on the exhibits, it is a great place for couples and/or children to take some memorable pictures of your time in Curitiba.

Easy access on the hop on - hop off Tourism Line. Beautiful and well tended gardens in the park - there is also a greenhouse (which is the symbol of the park) with samples of the local flora - many of which are endangered species plus a museum with stuffed samples of the local fauna - again many of which are endangered. About one hour should be enough for the visit.

This museum is located on the edge of Parque Barigui and is on the route of the double decker hop-on, hop-off tourist buses that travel round the city so it's easy to get to, and if you are visiting with family or friends who don't get excited by old cars they can relax in the park. The museum is quite small with about 50 cars on display at any one time although the collection is much larger and rotated so a return visit should reveal more cars that you didn't see the first time. The cars in the collection are mainly from the USA and include many rare vehicles. It must have the largest collection of Cords outside the USA for example, no less than 5 different examples. Also 4 assorted Lincoln Zephyr V12s from different years. There is even a Henry J which is not spectacular but not something I have ever seen before, or even knew about before I googled it. I could go on. It's not a big museum, but if you like rare cars, especially American cars, the quality is second to none. I have been to many car museums over the years and rate this very highly because there were so many cars that I haven't seen before and obviously many more in the collection that I have yet to see although I suspect that most of the really spectacular cars are there all the time and only the duller ones are rotated. Whatever, I need to go back again.

The Botanical Garden of Curitiba is the city's best-known attraction and well worth a visit. The views from the steps of the solarium offer an unparalleled photo opportunity of the cityscape. The only downside is the lack of sufficient parking spaces (Patrons circle the lot like vultures waiting to pounce on an opening. My host waited one-half hour for his.) However, there is a taxi stand directly in front of the Garden entrance and a bus stop quite close as well. The gift shop left something to be desired, as it was tiny in size and offerings. In retrospect, I'd wait to buy gifts and souvenirs at one of the weekend street markets.

For 25 Real there is a jump-on/jump-off city tour on a double-decker bus that allows 4 entries to a list of attractions. Some attractions are within walking distance of the city centre so it pays to acquire a map setting out the tour route - maps are available at the tourism booth located in front of the Rodoviaria; the tour bus departs on the other side of the road via the pedestrian crossing. One of the attractions reached by bus is the Botanical Gardens, which are immaculately presented. The gardens contain a lake area where locals picnic and grassy knolls for lazing in the sunshine or relaxing under a shade tree. A kiosk with outside tables and chairs supplies drinks and food and is located just inside the front gates. The main attractions are a metal greenhouse containing tropical plants and a natural spring, behind is an undercover art exhibition.

I expected a bit more of this botanical garden. It's still quite young and lacks the ambience of most botanical gardens, I've visited yet. It's a bit a general problem in Curitiba. Over the last two decades, they created out of the historical center theme parks (dedicated to one of the countries of origin of it's inhabitants) and lots of green infrastructure.

When you're here you almost forget you're in the middle of the city. This place is very beautiful, it has some colorful and well kept outdoor gardens, and in the greenhouse you can see a lot of brazilian plants and have a very nice view of the gardens. Use an hour or two to walk through the gardens and inside the greenhouse; but the Jardim Botânico is much bigger. The parking lot is small and is always full. Near the exit there's a souvenir shop and a cafeteria. It's also nice because it's free :)

When it comes to planning your trip to Curitiba, do not forget to put the Botanical Garden.<br>Opened in 1991, the Curitiba Botanical Garden is a tribute to Frances M. planner Rischbieter Garfunkel, one of the precursors in urban planning from the capital. The park is one of the tourist highlights of Curitiba and was even one of the venues for the election of the seven wonders of Brazil, in 2007.<br>The area contains approximately 245000 m², with several species of domestic and international plants grown in outdoor malls or in greenhouses with glass and iron structures, the main point of the park and was inspired by the Crystal Palace in London.<br>A fantastic place. Do not miss it.<br>

I drove to this place and the roads to this place were the worst I have seen! Huge potholes. I came in the back way also which may have been worse but left the other way and it was just as bad. They were fixing the holes on the way out and my wife said they were getting ready for the World Cup crowd. Going to this zoo I was thinking it would be a few animals and not worth the trip. Then the road made me think twice. Then when I got to the dirt parking lot I was sure it was a waste. I did go on a weekday and it was raining a little so not much of a crowd. Isnt it always raining anyway? They dont even charge and admission for this place! Its paid by the peoples taxes. Maybe thats why it looks so shabby on the outside? Then when we got through the gates I was surprised to find the place pretty nice! Its like two different worlds. Outside the gates no money! Inside the gates MONEY! I guess the brazilians are paying thier taxes. Lots of nice birds to see. I loved the Hippos as you can get real close to two of them. The Toucan was cool. <br><br>Anyway...what a bargain! Free. Great place to bring your kids and bring an extra stoller for the toddler as the other people are correct. Some big hills to walk up.

todays visit to the recife zoo made me extremely sad. The parc is nice and big, but unfortunately the animals are not the ones having any profit from this. They are on display in really old and small cages; which in no way increase their living quality. Looking at the depressed baboon and the bears in their way to small living space makes my heart cry. I guess this is the way a zoo looked 70 years ago, but really, for today standart this is nothing more than cruelty to the animals. Dear owners of this parc, please a trip to europe and visit some of the larger zoos around there, and see how things can be different. Your parc has soo much unused space that could be used to increase the living quality of the animals. In the meantime, if you love animals, then please do NOT go to this place.

The decline of the park started many years back. After revisiting the city I could only few sorry for the animals in captivity. I'm not a fan of zoos in the first place, but I wanted my young nephew to see the animals and what we found was quasi-abandoned, bored animals. <br><br>The park is big and very green. It could easily be turned into a great park for people to visit, without the need to incarcerate the poor animals that are clearly unhappy there. <br><br>The bear, for instance, was laying down with his pawn on the water, without moving for hours. A sign near the cage asked visitors to be quite because the bear was ""depressed"". I couldn't help but leave the place a bit depressed myself. <br><br>

This XIX century building can show you more than an old time architecture. The museum has a timeline of the history of Pernambuco state - from the indians to the modern arts. You will find here a collection of several porcelain items such as vases, dishes and teapots from China, Holland and France. The collection includes works of renowned artists as Cícero Dias, Telles Júnior, Francisco Brennand e Burle Max. In the indigenous sector, you will see a variety of instruments and artefacts used by the indians for hunting, cooking and play. The part of the dutch presence in the state is the best of all - you can't miss the tapestry presenting the Battle of Guararapes (Dutch against portuguese). During the whole year, there are several temporary exhibitions of local and brazilian artists - always an opportunity to enjoy something new, something different.

In the other direction this Avenue becomes another Avenue which also has someshoprs, stores, restaurants, etc. It is mostly safe. Anyway go around there during the day, not after 6 PM or so.

I really enjoyed the time we spent off our cruise ship in this former prison, now a thriving centre for arts and crafts. The 19th Century prison's cells now house a huge number of stalls or shops, most of whom seem tro be selling the same product, but who cares? The lace was beautiful and, by comparison with other touristy areas of Brazil, reasonably priced, mostly fixed but some shop owners seemed amenable to (modest) bargaining. The complex is in a yellow-painted area, well policed, not 500 metres away from the metropolitan cathedral. Better yet, upstairs they have housed the Museo de Artwe e Cultura featuring an impressive collection of Ceara regional crafts, including boats, folk art and other artisanal products.

'Feirinha da beira-mar' is unmissable! You can find a great range of crafts, local clothes, food and very friendly locals that will be happy to negotiate price! <br>My biggest tip is to get a handmade 'sand bottle' crafted with your name on it. It's an amazing art done with different colored sand and displaying a great view of Ceara!<br>And be prepared, you can find food, clothes, toys, cachaça and much much more, oh and some of the stalls accept cards- in case you are wondering... Great place to visit and go back to! 5pm-12am

Meireles beach is where most of Fortaleza's big hotels, restaurants and the famous handicrafts and souvenirs 'feirinha' are located. I would not swim there as it just looks (and smells!) unsafe. Fortaleza is one of those places where great riches and extreme poverty live side by side and this beach is certainly a strong example of that. Beware of the beach side 'barracas' where they advertise a reasonable price for their food and drinks and then charge you a hefty 'service' fee.

Without a doubt, that’s my favorite beach ever. And the most amusing. In the morning is very quiet, just a few people and there’s no shade, good for those who like to literally get sunburned. But you won’t find barracas de praia (a kind of beach-side bars), beach chairs, kiosks, nothing like that. Some say it’s polluted, I don’t doubt it. I confess I have taken a dip there and I didn’t feel nothing strange. It’s a fine place to watch the sunset. You can go untill the end of a pier and enjoy a beautiful view, most times the sky gets kind of reddish/orange. It is worth seeing. Next to the beach lies the Cultural Center Dragão do Mar, tPirata’s Bar, the Public Library, Monsenhor Tabosa Avenue, the Acquario Ceará, and many nightclubs, bars, hotels and restaurants.<br>The nights always come with the bustle. All kind of people gather here, especially around the Iracema Statue. You fill find children roller-skating, families, locals, gringos (foreigners), posh kids with preppy clothes, rockers, pot smokers. Everything! Walking a bit you can find the Ponte Metálica, a kind of pier pretty charming that looks like the Brighton Pier in England. I have done so many things in this beach that I could write a book, a big one! What I like most to do here is to meet my friends, have a chat or just simply to sit on the sand at night and stare the sea, thinking about my life. Who never did this?!

Mercado Central is a good place to go in Fortaleza if you want to see most of what is available in Fortaleza all in one place. But, atmosphere wise I prefer to shop at the booths down by the beach on Beira Mar. As far as I could tell the prices weren't very different, if at all, between the two places. There are also some good tourist shops downtown on the other side of the big Catholic Cathedral from Mercado Central and are within walking distance of Mercado Central. I also would highly recommend the CeART store which is at Av. Santos Dumont, 1589, Aldeota. I think it is run by the government of Ceara (the state Fortaleza is in), and is meant to promote art in the state. I thought the prices were very reasonable and the items were more artisitic, unique and I think they are all handmade. CeART is actually my favorite place for souvenir shopping in Fortaleza. If you don't have a lot of time for shopping, I would just go to the booths on Beira Mar and to CeART and would skip the Mercado Central all together. I've spent quite a bit of time in Fortaleza because my parents live there and I've done a lot of shopping, so trust me on this one. Overall, the Mercado Central is okay, but there is better shopping in Fortaleza.

When you're on a cruise, you can choose your itinerary, sure. But sometimes they'll throw a port that makes sense for the ship, but not for you. Fortaleza is one of these places. It's pretty clear that for the tourist, Fortaleza is a place to stretch your legs and hold onto your purse (or wallet) and your reales. Our ship provided free shuttles to the Mercado Central, which is a 5 or 6 story building a little like Water Tower Place in Chicago...without the stores, the merchandise or the glamor. This place, some 25 minutes by bus from the waterfront, invites visitors to wander from stall to stall looking for something Brazilian and nice. Not an easy task. Lots of junk, lots of sandals of questionable origin, maybe a pair of sunglasses if you forgot to pack some, and lots of tacky knick-knacks. But if you are fond of cashews, you are in luck. There are cashews in nut form, wine form and other forms. Go for it. You'll never see so many cashews in one place again.

This was our last port of call in Brazil. As soon as we docked the rain started and didn't stop until late afternoon. It's no fun trying to sight see in the rain, even if it is warm rain, so we opted to take a taxi from the Cruise terminal to the Central Market. We only had a lottle local money left so it was handy thaere was an efficient maney echange at the Port. There were many taxis at the new terminal and we shared a taxi with another couple with the same idea, cost 30$R haggeled down from 40$R. As we left the heavens opened, the driver said it wold only last a couple of hours...wrong! Our driver who only spoke Portuguese trid to point out buildings of interest on the way to the market and handed a map around. He also warned us to be careful with our wallets. The driver didn't take the coast road, but the one behind, although coming back we used the coast road with all the high rise hotels. However some of the roads were flooded and the volume of water had lifted the drain covers and water was flowing out over the road. We passed lots of high rise hotels, the traffic wasn’t as manic as we’d seen in Rio. We arrived at the Market in the pouring rain and quickly went inside for some cover. There was an old lady dancing outside with a life sized puppet and a small band, there was a crowd around her, plus a few stalls and a man dressed as a silver statue.The building itself was jammed full of stalls on several levels, joined by stairs, a lift and ramps, But once you had seen one level you’d seen it all…everywhere there were the same dresses, t shirts, leather shoes, cases, bags condiments, gifts, tablecloths children’s clothes etc. The was something we hadn’t seen before....couscous steamers individual and doubles.Most of the shops were very small and narrow, but outside in the main areas there were quite a few place to sit down and rest, but the higher you went the hotter it was. We also saw our first self service restaurant where the self service buffet was laid out, you helped yourself to whatever you wanted and then you paid by the weight of the food.These were on the outer rim on the ground floor there were some self service café which charge by weight , about 3.40$R for 100grams. We went to each floor and down into the car park area where we had a nice freshly made mango juice for 6$R each. My husband used the toilets and said they were being cleaned all the time, we also bought a large red wooden parrot for 65$R, (now hanging on our terrace) I bought a small wooden spoon 6R$ and a couple of Key rings for 3R$, We bought a t Shirt vest for 12$R. It was very hot, humid and tiring in the market but there were plenty of places to sit down and rest a while.There was also a river/canal along the back of the market building. The cathedral was just along from the Market but we couldn’t face walking in the rain to it. There was a money exchange outside the market, which had an armed guard. Again we took a taxi back to the Cruise terminal and the money exchange there changed the last of our Brazilian money back to Euros, GBP or USD, whatever you wanted.

Iracema is the main character in a famous book, an Indian virgin of rare beauty as the author describes with an excess of adjectives. The beach is amazing when you first look at it: turquoise waters, yellow sand, palm tress. But then you start finding some odd ends: the sidewalk where one can jog ends abruptly in the middle of the beach; the beach was basically empty, no one was sunbathing or even walking on the sand; and a close look shows that the water is not as clean as the blue color suggests.

Its very easy to be distracted in the market during the evenings. But this is a dangerous place. I was rushed from behind near Subway, held up with a gun pointing at my head, and my valuables demanded of me. When I said I didn't have anything, one of the late teen robbers grabbed my gold neck chain and yanked it with such force it cut my neck before snapping. They then ran onto the Meireles Beach to make their getaway, firing as they went.<br>Whilst the police took me to the station to make a report, the criminal suddenly became me as I was told it is illegal to walk without your passport. They threatened to deport me. All interest in the real villains had evaporated. I wonder how much they are paid by the gangs?<br>My Brasilian friends were mortified. They complain about the widespread corruption in Brasil. Additionally, an attempt was made to extract £7,000 from my current account while I was there, stopped only by the vigilance of HSBC fraud department. Thank you, HSBC.

We just spent a week here and did not want to leave, people are great, scenery was awesome, food was just so good and the drinks were much better than expected. There was a lot of talk about security before our trip, but the people in that whole area depend on tourism and are more than welcoming everyone. You feel like a celebrity and there wasn't a day when we felt unwelcome. At first glance it looks like a beach in Mexico, but much cleaner and with more relaxed warmer people. <br>I can go on and on, but believe me, you just have to go.

Stayed in Fortaleza for 7 weeks over the summer and can honestly say I spent around 80% of that time around Beira Mar. The beach is to die for, the markets that open at around sunset are amazing, and the food from the square is delicioso! The people are so lovely and the atmosphere is buzzing at any time of day.<br>The only I would say is that it can get very dangerous at night, which is normal in Brazil so just watch out, don't take out anything too valuable and you'll be fine.<br><br>Would definitely recommend Beira Mar to anyone that comes to Fortaleza!

That’s the famous Meireles beach you can see on postcards, with a beautiful promenade, luxury buildings, 5 stars hotels etc. In the morning is visited especially by tourists. You’ll barely see a local bathing in this beach. What they most like to do here is just wander, I mean, walking around.<br>And it’s a great beach to do so, to go for a jogging, to stroll with your family, to flirt, to drink a beer, to see limousines and luxury cars passing by (Fortaleza is the Brazilian city with the second highest number of imported cars), and to go shopping in the handicraft fair. Just a tip, it’s way better to buy things here than in the Market City. Here you can find the same things and cheaper. Another tip, every day after 10 pm some sellers come and scatter their products over there on the floor and they are normally cheaper then the products of the same fair. I bought it there myself several times.

This market is an experience. There are four floors mainly of souvenirs, mostly linen, shoes, bags and bad kids clothes. The sort of things you buy and then get home and wonder why you bought them. From the outside the place looks like a modern shopping centre. It's very deceiving when you get inside and is quite old fashioned. Barter if you're going to buy.

You can find everything there.... good restaurants, coconut water, comedians show, handcraft and food fair, street artists, people go there to skate, cycling, chat, jog.. and all that with a special and unique ocean breeze. <br>The only negative point might be security.

Beira Mar Avenue is a place to relax, a place where you can walk all day, drinking a “caipirinha” (Brazilian national drink made with lime, sugar and cachaça) or a cold coconut water or just enjoy the scenery. It is not a long ocean walk; we can easily walk the whole avenue in less than 30 minutes. There are some restaurants, hotels, apartments buildings and shops along the way, but the best is the sceneries, the temperature and the breeze. What is really sad is that the water here is not good to swim. At sunset, at Meireles area of Beira Mar, there is a flea market, everyday, with lots of small shops where we can find every handiwork that Ceará manufactures. Enjoy the ride.

We walked over to the Centro de Turismo do Ceará after wandering through the few floors of Mercado Central. While the grounds and architecture of the former prison were mildly interesting, I guess I was expecting more craftsmanship or local flavor to the shops in the state tourism center.

This is housed in a former prison. Once inside, it is a sort of relief from the hustle and bustle of the city. Most of the stalls sells local handicraft, mainly fabric made products.

What they most like to do here is just wander, I mean, walking around.<br>And it’s a great beach to do so, to go for a jogging, to stroll with your family, to flirt, to drink a beer, to see limousines and luxury cars passing by (Fortaleza is the Brazilian city with the second highest number of imported cars), and to go shopping in the handicraft fair. Just a tip, it’s way better to buy things here than in the Market City. Here you can find the same things and cheaper. Another tip, every day after 10 pm some sellers come and scatter their products over there on the floor and they are normally cheaper then the products of the same fair. I bought it there myself several times.

My wife and I went to this show; she is Brazilian and from Ceará, I'm English and still learning the language. However I really enjoyed it, the actors, singers and dancers are great and they involve the audience and draw you into the story. The show tells the story about the birth of the state of Ceará from it's Indian beginning and along the way we meet a host of important characters from the history of Ceará, such as The Dragon of the Sea (Dragão Do Mar), Iracema (the Indian woman who gave birth to the first Cearense), Seu Lunga (an angry but very funny old man) and many others.<br><br>Great songs, great show, great performance.

I went there on 03-Jul-2014, the day before the World Cup quarter-final between Brazil and Colombia. <br><br>I walked from the pier in Praia de Iracema to there which took slightly over an hour (at leisure pace). I needed a break as it was quite hot. Some of the streets nearby looked a bit rough, so I decided to go inside this cathedral to have a short rest. It was decent inside and the crowd seemed to be mostly tourists at the time. Architecture wise, it looked more or less like other large cathedrals in Sao Paulo that I have seen. <br><br>I wouldn't say this is a ""must"" to visit, but if you happen to be around, then go in and have a look.

This attraction was recommended to us by the locals in Cumbuco. It is approximately 40 to 50 minutes from Fortaleza/Cumbuco in Maranguape. It combined the history of the area and the family responsible for producing Ypioca, with samples of sugar cane juice and cachaca with an 'adventure park' experience for all the family. There are two entrance prices depending on what you want to do for the day. There was far more available than we could do in one day (and you are able to buy passes for more than one day). You can visit the Museum itself (which doesn't take long), have a sample of cachaca, see the largest wooden barrel in the World, go on pedaloes, borrow bikes, relax in a hammock, paintballing, archery, kayaking, zip lining, a climbing wall, paddle boarding, a ride in a speedboat or in a horse and carriage ... the list goes on. The Brazilian guides were all helpful and anxious to show off their English. We were even assigned our own English speaking guide, who was excellent. There was a also a 'per kilo' buffet lunch available, which compared very favourably with others we had experienced. We also thought it was a good idea to give you a 'swipe' card rather than having to carry cash around. One of the best days of our holidays by far. We would definitely recommend a vist.

Prraia do Futuro has many beaches but I recommend Barraca do Carangeijo or Crocobeach. They are prepared for international tourism and have good food which is not too expensive. Also if you have kids there are attractions there like pools. Security is good but you have to keep an eye on your stuff like always in Brazil.<br>The waves and tides are to be taken into account. Dont go too deep. The ocean has great force and is sometimes underestimated by not local people.<br>It is nice to have a walk but dont go too much to the left (if watching the ocean in front of you) because at the end of the beach live poorer people. Anyway it is a long way to get there so probably you won't even see that.<br>If you do not want to have food in the restaurant then you can have it from the people who sell it on the beach (cajew nuts, little lobsters, oysters, grilled cheese, etc). It is allowed to have a seat at the beach and eat food brought or boughgt from the outside. Not so in the restaurant by itself.<br><br>Come early (10 AM) to get a seat in front of the beach and leave at 5 PM or so so you dont get into the leaving crowd.<br><br>Take the air conditioned busses (guess it is 1 dollar per person or so). Not the little busses (they may have too A/C) because thtey go through a poor village. It is kinda safe but you might not like it or feel insecure. Also there is only locals which might not understand your questions.<br><br>Outside the beaches there is nothing to do. Just get off the bus and go to the beach and when leaving just take it. Maybe you can buy some stuff at the stores when leaving the bus like bikinis or sun blockers, etc....that is ok, but dont walk around much. You will see that there are almost no houses but plain terrains. Watch out and go with people if possible.<br>

From the outside one might think to skip visitng Fortaleza's Metropolitan Cathedral. (see photo #1) The exterior is laden with a century of city grime. Only over the entrance has it been recently cleaned. It would be a mistake to miss the interior of this beautiful cathedral. Situated in the heart of a bustling area with good, available street parking close by, inside the cathedral it is quiet and peaceful. The interior is gleaming white (see photo #2.) You will find stained glass windows rivaling some of the best of European cathedrals. (Photo #3) I would highly recommend a few minutes away from city hustle spent inside this outwardly dark and forbidding church.

Beautiful beaches and lots of different barracas (beach clubs) to choose from. Some for families; some for the in crowd. Ask around before going as there are distances between the restaurants (most have a long beach expanse) and some are boarded up and are out of business.

This is an impressive, austere looking Cathedral and in terms of age, quite young, built between 1939 – 1978 - over 40 years to complete without Government assistance.The style of architecture is Gothic - Roman with two imposing spire towers and a square roof cupolpa in the middle of this typical cruciform structure. <br><br>Walking around the exterior we noticed the ‘cement’ like masonry with weather affected ‘black’ spots that adds some colour to the church’s plain façade. Flying buttresses, arched windows, the omnipresent round stained glass windows above the entry and at each of the cruciform sections reminded us of the typical churches of France – the architect was French.<br><br>Inside is where this church comes into it’s own – built to hold 5,000 patrons and is the third largest in Brazil. It’s mostly white and after the drab appearance outside, the light filtering through the glorious stained glass windows provide a kaleidoscope of colour. Many columns support the vaulted ceiling that is unadorned and a few side chapels gave an insight into the importance of some saints.<br><br>This is a beautiful church and it stands out like a beacon in the middle of this thriving city. Not too far away is the Central Handicraft Market and within a short walk is The Fortress of Nossa Senhora da Assuncao.<br><br>Enjoy your experience!

It’s world-famous. The best city of the beach to go bathing. It has an excellent infrastructure, with huge beach-side bars with all kinds of amenities like restaurants, pools, water slides, playgrounds, life guards, wifi, live music, DJs, some of them looks more beach clubs than side-bar beaches. The most busy days are the weekends and Thursdays when you can find comedy shows and popular crab dishes.<br>It’s one of the few beachs of Ceará that is free from jeeps, buggies and quadriclycles on the sand. However be careful with the waves, the current here is very strong, it’s very common to drown. Avoid long stretches of deserted beach, since this is the favorite beach of the tourists, it’s also the favorite beach of the muggers. The only thing in the Praia do Futuro that bothers me is the massive presence of beach peddlers. Just another tip, try your best to avoid stay in a hotel nearby. Although there are great hotels, the night is very deserted too, therefore dangerous. And you would always need a taxi to go anywhere. Believe me!

This beach is beautiful-- you must go to the area called ""Croco-Beach"", which has large, thatched umbrellas to sit under for protection from the sun. The water is beautiful, which waves breaking at intervals on their way to the shore, very beautiful. There are tide pools; great for dipping. The sand is very wide, ideal for a soccer on the sand type of game or for other activities near, but not in the water. Lots of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages too; fruit, lobster, shrimp, etc... Fun place-- wear sun tan lotion to protect yourselves...<br><br>Oh yes-- Taxi is the way to go there, but must leave prior to 5PM as there is crime after that hour. This is a must.

If you want to enjoy a beach, strong sun and drink some beer. Praia do futuro is a great choice, cuz is easy to arrive there, the landscape is pretty awesome, perfect to relax. The restaurants has a great variety of food, including fishes, crabs, shrimps, meat, whatever you want with a soft touch of northwest's flavor. Every time you'll see some sellers around the beach, with fantastics products, renna tatoo, accessories at all(great kind of souvenirs).

Went to watch the Brazil v Colombia QF and the atmosphere was brilliant from start to finish. Modern stadium, although built in a part of the City where as a foreigner I did not feel comfortable staying around pre/post the match. Therefore arranged for a taxi to and from the stadium from Iracema Beach area which worked well especially with the cordon around the stadium. Cost approx. 60Rs.<br>Seat was in the 200 level around the halfway line and was an excellent view of the game.<br>Facilities are good although service was slow because of the large crowd for the game.<br>Wonderful experience never to be forgotten.

This beautiful, newly beautiful stadium is in a bad neighborhood. FIFA and the city provided free shuttle buses from the Hotel Zone, Local Malls,etc., but one still had to walk over a mile in the hot sun through a favela.

Was here for the Brazil v Columbia game.<br><br>1) It was quite a bus ride from the main strip. Probably took over 30 minutes to get to the drop off point, then a long walk to the stadium. It's fine for a vibrant match, as you enjoy the trip and walk but otherwise it would be a pain.<br><br>2) After the game there was a literal CRUSH of people trying to move around. There area outside the stadium is too small, and I saw plenty of women and children being crushed. I'm not one to feel claustrophic, but a crowd of drunk guys after a match moving as a herd is generally not fun.<br><br>3) The buses leaving the stadium were very far away and had MASSIVE lines. Yes, par for the course for a world cup maybe, but we did not experience this at stadiums like Arena Fonte Nova, mostly because it was more centrally located. <br><br>The reliance on buses here really makes it hard to get to and from. I'd take Fonte Nova over this any day.<br><br>The stadium itself is relatively standard. It's easy to find your seat and theres a fair distribution of bathrooms etc.

I visited the arena during the 2014 FIFA World Cup and got very impressed by the size and architecture of the whole stadium. Its capacity is around 60k people comfortably seated in individual seats, the ventilation of the arena is very good, and the circulation around different sectors is also very easy. It is quite far away from Beira-Mar/Iracema Beach but during the event they organized parking lots in the main shopping centers from where you could take a free bus directly to the arena (around 1~2km away). For elderly and children there were direct buses up to the entrance of the stadium.

Visited the arena twice during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Both times were amazing. I moved around the stadium during the matches and almost every view is a good view here.<br>The upper and lower grandstands are not connected which means that this is one of the few stadiums in which it pays off to get a higher priced ticket if you wanna sit closer to the pitch. The view from the upper grandstand is amazing though, so settleling for a lower priced ticket will still grant you a great view.

The outside of the Stadium is not that great, but the grounds itself and the inside are just amazing, you can watch the whole game from basically anywhere as if you were on the pitch.

Spent a nice day at Praia do Futuro which offers many services including several restaurants, lockers you can rent, lounge chairs (ask at any of the restaurants), clean bathrooms, and a kids play area. You can also get a good 60 minute massage right on the beach (we paid $50 rais or about $18). The portions at the restaurants were large and the food was pretty good and not very expensive. There are plenty of well shaded tables under thatched roofs for those who want to get out of the sun for a bit. The place gets pretty crowded which can make for slow service at the restaurants at times. The only downside is the super aggressive people who are selling trinkets and other stuff and don't seem to understand the phrase ""no thank you."" They are especially pesky in the restaurant area but tend to leave you alone if you are sitting on the beach. Overall I liked it and would go back.

This is a long beach with clear sands and green ocean. It faces the open sea, so the waves are usually not very calm. It is very good to take a walk or run. In all its length there are tipical restaurants and bars, direct in the beach sands. Most of them very nice. In the evening, You can find shows in some of them. But if You are a foreigner, I advise to ask in your hotel witch are the places You can go securely. Try to fix with a táxi driver known in the hotel to take You there and pick You back. Fortaleza has some security issues, mainly at night. Don't dress as You where in Hawaii with flowered shirts. That Will reveal that You are a tourist and bring You street sellers and possibly a thief. No visible golden or expansive whatches either.

This is your 70-80s Picture Wallpaper come true. Coconut Trees all the way down to the beach. And obviously the grow naturally here and not being planted like at the Cote Azure in France or so.<br><br>Remember that Fortaleza is located almost directly under the equator which means seasons are almost missing here, therefore when you make yourself comfortable under those coconut trees check first whats hanging there above you! Who wants to have a fresh coconut falling in his/her head ...<br><br>Next amazing thing is the water temperature. Even further out it is warmer than the mediteranean. If you want to cool down you have will have to use the hotel pool, the water there is cooler. This is the open Atlantic Ocean though, so waves can be quite high even on quiet days and there are some underwater currents that you should watch when you go swimming.<br><br>Saturdays all the locals are at the beach as well, playing football. Just have a seat in the sand watching the locals play football at the beach is entertaining and from then on you know why Brasil is 5 times World Champion!<br><br>About safety: The Beach is located within a poorer area of town. To avoid unpleasant situations one might want to dress like the locals, which usually is rubber flip flops, shorts and a tank top or a T-Shirt. Any kind of valuables however belong in the hotel safe. Secondly stay in the area where the hotels and the beach clubs are. If you continue to wander north on the beach you will notice that the houses look more and more run down. That is when you turn round and start walking back to where you came from. We stayed at a hotel at Praia Futuro for two weeks and were all fine.<br><br>The Sun: I am mixed race and do not need any kind of sunprotection anywhere in europe, I had a proper sunburn after an extended two hour walk on the beach. Next I saw a local girl whos skin colour was almost black and she used sunblocker factor 15.<br><br>If you are a white person please do yourself a favour and get proper sunprotection, otherwise the sun will burn you like deep red to an extent that didn't look healthy to me anymore.<br><br>Once a week all the clubs at the beach offer fresh crabs which is also a very nice experience, sitting in a nice bar at the beach with a bowl of crabs in front of you and a hammer...

If you stay in your ""resort"" area (restaurant / bar) and just enjoy the food and scenery, you should be okay, but if you go for a walk on the beach after lunch like we did -- even though a busy beach with lots of activity and broad daylight -- you might get robbed. My husband and I were having a lovely day when we were aggressively grabbed, yelled at and shaken by two thiefs. We had to give them our bag. Thankfully, some kind local men playing soccer nearby chased the thieves, who dropped everything but our new camera. The people helped us get to the police and tell them the story and even caught one of the thiefs! Big thanks to the people who helped us -- we are grateful. But we don't recommend visiting this beach.

Great beach and excellent sea food. The beer is fantastic and served cold at the main refreshment stands. To be safe stay close to the main restaurant stands. People have been known to be robbed right on the beach. Order the local crab or grilled fish. The coconuts are fresh and chilled to the right temperature. Food is cheap by Canadian standards so eat up . Parking is always hard to find on weekends, so avoid those if you can. Lock your rental car always and pay the guy to find you a spot. Avoid the outer areas and don't swim to far out due to the strong currents. As always the people are friendly but be cautious and like mom say's don't talk to strangers.

Praia do Futuro is beach located a few kilometers outside central Fortaleza, Brazil. It is prettier and much cleaner than the other city beaches which are polluted to the point of being unusable. Futuro has dozens of large barracas, or beach restaurants that generally are open only during the day and on Thursday nights. My favorite one is Coco Beach, which serves an excellent traditional feijoada buffet with two live bands (typically one forro, the other samba), every Saturday afternoon. The bands can be quite good.<br><br>Unfortunately Futuro beach is not great for swimming, given undertows and dangerous surf. That is not the only danger, as Futuro borders a large favela which makes walking around the streets during day risk and absolutely unsafe at night.

If you're looking for light adventures and excellent food, Cumbuco's beach is a great choice. There you can walk by buggies, tricycle, jet ski, Parachutes, and others. The restaurants serves a fantastic food, but be careful, if don't eat a lot, you can divide with your friend, cause te quantity is absurd hehe.

This city/beach is one of my favorite spots for kitesurfing on the planet, consistent wind and flat lagoons make it perfect. There are some awesome restaurants and many on a budget in case you are on a sports on a budget trip, for those who do not kitesurf, they have this buggy trips which are also fun, not as fun as kitesurf of course!

We were staying in a hotel at Praia do Futuro and were shocked by the lack of security. The hotel structure (restaurant and bar) on the beach is full of security guards and the are always advising the customers not to leave the area because it's dangerous. So disappointing... we couldn't even go for a walk on the beach and had to run in the gym at the hotel. The beach is full of salespeople, offering you things to buy all the time and you can't even rest peacefully. It looked a bit dirty too. Definitely, not a place to visit.

Went to Praia de Cumbuco today on the advice of a taxi driver and it was definitely worth the 50 minute ride over bumpy roads. The beach is very nice but really windy. However we got to see some great kite surfing. The restaurant on site isn't fancy but the food was decent and not very expensive. You can get a massage, go horse back riding or do a dune buggy trip. We were quoted $200 rais for the dune buggy which seemed very expensive given that we're doing the dune buggy at Morro Bronco for only $50 rais. The bathrooms here are clean and have showers.There are a couple of shops that sell sunblock, bathing suits, and other beach things. People come by and try to sell you things but aren't as aggressive and annoying as the vendors at Praia Fortuna. Overall, I recommend Cumbuco as a far less crowded and quieter option than Praia Fortuna. The only downside is that it is harder to get to. We took a taxi and paid the driver to wait for us because there are no taxi stands on site or nearby. There is a bus from Fortaleza but we didn't bother with that. The taxi and wait time cost $180 rais for 4 people (about $60 US).

This is by far the most sought after beach among locals. Unlike Meireles on Sundays, it doesn't get too crowded, due to Praia do Futuro's sheer length -some 6 km! The sea itself is rather unpleasant for swimming due to strong currents and undertows, but for a dip it is fine. A seemingly endless (100+ officially) string of shacks of all sizes serves drinks and food all the way. For a change of scenery go to the very end, Caca e Pesca, where the river Coco cuts into the ocean. Be very careful as dusk approaches, as muggings are frequent.

Tropical trade winds blow steady on this beautiful beach on the outskirts of Fortaleza just beyond the Petrobras refinery. Surfers and kitesurfers are all over the wild waves here, the sand is wonderful to walk on and the huge barracas like Croco Beach resort take the pain out of spending a day at the beach. Beneath the waving palms you can have a drink, have lunch, have a massage, or relax in a chaise lounge while a steady parade of beach salesmen offer everything from hats to oils, sunglasses to jewellery, fresh shrimp to caranguejo (crab).

Praia do Futuro is teaming with lots of beach clubs (Barracas) all offering great service and reasonable prices for beverages and food. We settled on Barraca ""Aqua Na Boca"", their service was excellent (nothing too much trouble) and beer prices were reasonable. They way they sort out the beverages is a lesson to other countries; You are given a plastic barrel full of ice and the drinks that you are likely to need during i.e. beer, coke, water) At the end of the day they count up how much you consumed and you pay for what you drank - Simple! <br>The beach was pleseant - the water was very warm. There's a lot of surf, but that is to be expected here. There are plenty of beach vendors but they do tend to leave you alone as they walk through. The Barraca boys are there to help you wish anything from moving sunbeds to whatever you might need them. there is a bar and a toilet and showers too, so all you need for a good day's sunbathing. By the way, the seafood is excellent and makes a perfect accompaniment to the ice cold beer! We had many a great day here, it can get windy and sometimes a win-break would have helped, but all in all - a very nice club with very attentive staff.

Praia do Futuro is a long way to go from Fortaleza.. It took us 50 min in a steaming sweaty no-airconditioning bus from the terminal, then another bus but shorter distance. The plus was that it was less crowded and it was a free service ,which doesn't happen often in Brazil. The beach was empty and clean... low season .. just a few locals enjoyed the crazy waves and sipped beer at the beach restaurant near by..There were lockers, showers and bathrooms, clean and empty. We didn't stay to have dinner as the prices were not for the low season, they just forgot to adjust them, I guess. We took a bus to the downtown and for the second evening in a row bought 1 kg of fresh shrimp at Beira mar beach which is around the corner from the cooking place.. For almost a song. you can buy different sizes of shrimp, fish fillet is more expensive but lobsters are a treat.... The restaurant, if you can call it so, makes money by cooking the seafood that you give them, and offeres rice,fried jucca, veggies.. Shrimp was delicious with lots of garlic and herbs but the fried fillet of fish was ruined by over-salting..Then we walked on the avenue that runs along the beach... could see a running man who had stolen something from a tourist and disappeared within a sec....

This beach is perfect if you want to surf or just relax. You can sit in the sand and eat lunch or swim in the surf. The food is reasonably priced and the atmosphere is perfect. Not much else to do so don't plan on doing much else. It was a little windy when I was there but that cannot be controlled, obviously. The only negative is the constant onslaught of venders that ask you to buy little trinkets, towels, jewelry, etc.

The beach is clean and the sand is very nice. But there is hardly anything else. The beach bars/cafes and OK (best one we found was at the very end - the Atlantis. There we found good service and some atmosphere)<br>Due to its location the water is always chopy and it's very windy. Which would be fine for sports, but we didn't see one single wind- or kitesurfer out. Nor any other wateractivities. <br>Interesting part was, that we hardly saw any other ""western"" tourists, but mainly brazilians.<br>A day or two at the beach in a nice beach restaurant are ok. wouldn't plan more though,

Cumbuco was the highlight throughout my stay at Fortaleza. We took a bus tour and the tour guide only spoke Portugese but it didn't matter. When we reached there, we shared a buggy with 2 new friends and experienced some 45 degrees angles on the sand dunes. Exhilarating! We also did the butt ski down the sand dunes to the water. There was also fresh coconut juice. We spent the rest of the afternoon lazing by the beach enjoying very affordable refreshing caipirinhas. Once you get back to Fortaleza, you should pig out at their local churrascaria after such a fun day at the beach. Certainly would like to go back !

A stunning beach in a relatively safe area of Ceara close to Fortaleza. Very popular with kitesurfers especially at weekends. It has some lovely 'barracas' (beach bars) where you can while away the time drinking cocktails and having lunch. The only downsides are the sea is not particularly good for swimming as there is a strong current and waves. You can get pestered by beach sellers (although they usually disappear after a firm 'nao'). One of the most stunning beaches I have ever visited.

I love Cumbuco. It's so beautiful, the kiting is excellent, felt very safe and people are welcoming. Not a huge amount of choice for nightlife, but maybe this will change. I did not like Fortaleza itself, and was told many stories of muggings etc. However, some of the Italians I met went out partying there and had no problems. <br><br>I have never been to such a nice kiting spot (although I have only been to Europe and Morocco). Admittedly Tarifa is better for nightlife and things to do. Despite the expensive flight to Fortaleza, Cumbuco is still a cheaper option for us from the UK.

Not far from Fortaleza, Cumbuco beach is probably the best choice to get your feet wet, due to the fact that the ocean water on Fortaleza is not proper for bathing. The Barracas around the area are the place to stay, to enjoy the sand, water and sun. Not easy to choose from, but the one I felt was the best is the one from the Eco Paradise Hotel, cause it has a pool that you can dive, shower and a nice restaurant. It is also a little far from the other close-by Barracas.

It's an OK beach, but dirty (overall Fortaleza is NOT clean at all, one cas spot trash in all beaches); too many people walking back and forth trying to sell you all kinds of stuff.

If there were not the BARRACAS, it would not drive attention. But there are. Some of them big as ""theme parks"". With good service. You don`t need to have a private island to be served by the sea with crab, beer and fun. No, here you can. Therre are environmentalists who claim the beach should be cleared.

We were here with local friends and that's always the best option. Everyone hides under the sunshades because the Fortaleza sun knows no mercy. Around us, several older gays with their local toyboys, some lesbians and local guys showing off. With all the itinerant traders, absolutely no shortage of snacks. But the main dish we ordered in the barraca. Good stuff. A guard keeps an eye on everything, backwards to the sea.<br>But even locals have to watch out as in full day light, 4 boys approached one of our friends who went for a swim and robbed his gold necklace.

The whole beach is almost 13 Km of beauty with very warm water, easily catch from the Meireles and Iracema beach by the bus 52 or by the seacoast air bus called TOP BUS, both cost R$ 2,00 + or - US$ 1, in about 20 minutes. The best and most complete place to stay is CROCOBEACH, with a complete structure like chairs, special sun umbrellas,swimming polls with tobogans, delightful restaurant ,good bath with shower; but unfortunately the most expensive place from all.<br>The main problem there is in terms of careful when getting off and on the bus or even the car.

I'd heard that Fortaleza isn't a particularly nice city (it isn't) so rather than have to stay there twice on a trip round North East Brazil we thought we'd head to the quaint sounding fishing village of Cumbuco 40km away. Our pousada was a million times better than the dump we stayed at in Fortaleza. At all costs avoid a place called Villa Casa Nostra in Meireles it's one of the worst places we stayed at during our entire trip. But I have to say we were pretty disappointed by the beach in Cumbuco. Great conditions for kitesurfing, you can also take lessons there, but the beach itself was dirty. It's the only beach we visited in Brazil where we came across rubbish - plastic bottles, glass and a variety of used items - strewn across the beach which is a shame. And there are so many other more beautiful beaches in North East Brazil - try Jericoacoara or Canoa Quebrada instead.

This is a nice beach for bathing. It is 8 km of sand and sun, clean and beautiful. By the sidewalk, there are lots of ""barracas"" ofering showers, beach chairs and regional food. The most known ""barracas"" are Chico do Caranguejo (for those who like crab), Vira Verão, Itapariká, Cabumba and Crocobeach. We went to the Crocobeach one, and we loved it. There's a nice area to seat and sun bath by the beach, a nice swimming pool and a delicious food buffet. Definetely a good place to stay and enjoy a relaxing day, with everything you need by the reach of your hands. There are also lots of sales people bringing you all sort of handicrafts and other thins, like a mobile mall, you just seat there and they come to you - fun! Some people don't like it, as the salesmen keep bugging you the whole day, but that's the way it is. We didn't join in, but there are also shows of forró and stand up comedy on Thursdays evening.

We tried visiting it 3 different times, and almost everything was closed. Granted it was Easter week, but only one of the galleries were open. The entire place is closed on Mondays During the rest of the week it seems to pick up at night, but only after 20:00. Cool to see, but don't expect much.

Only visited this area during the daytime. On the day I visited, most of the museums, planetarium and other exhibit was closed. It is indeed very much a cultural center, both modern and traditional. There are some nice colonial buildings - which I believe at night is where the place becomes active. On some days, they do have down in the garden a make shift stage for performances. Not sure of the safety around the area after dark.

The Drago do Mar is supposedly one of Fortaleza's principal tourist attractions. Sadly, it delivers little of interest to the tourist. We visited on a Sunday. There was not much to see or do. <br><br>The Museum of Ceara Culture was open and there were two exhibition areas. One was a limited and poorly curated exhibition of local art. As far as ""art"" goes the displays verged on the banal .... for example a display of two card board cutout masks looked like an elementary school art project. A few other items were a bit more sophisticated, perhaps reaching the high school level. The sand paintings in small bottles were cute, but essentially these seemed like the kind street vendors sell to tourists along the beach. This area took five to ten minutes to see.<br><br>The second exhibit was worthwhile -- it was an exhibit focused on the cowboys of the Sertao (the dry interior backcountry). This exhibit was well put together and informative. But, unfortunately much of it couldn't be appreciated since there was no lighting in many of the gallery areas. Very poor curating here. <br><br>The Contemporary Art Museum was closed.<br><br>There really wasn't much else to see. A band seemed to be getting ready to play at about 5 pm in the small plaza area near the planetarium (closed) and a handful of vendors of handicraft products were set up nearby. There is a cafe serving food and drinks at reasonable prices.<br><br>The streets around the center were littered with trash and the surrounding neighborhood seemed a bit rough (no place for a tourist after dark).

Not many people around late in the afternoon but it gets lively later at night with music and dancing.<br>Enjoyed the planetarium exhibit and show and had a delicious expresso in a delightful small coffee place.

The theater hosted the opening ceremony of an important event, so it was possible to walk through the place, see its many balconies, sit on its straw chairs, and watch an orchestra and a choir, just to realize the acoustics could have been much better.<br><br>Anyway, the place is really beautiful, and deserves to be visited, because of its remarkable inner facade, combining stained glass and metal, probably the most recognizable building in Fortaleza, and one of the most original art-nouveau constructions in Brazil. The side garden, with its carefully kept palm trees, is a good place to stop for a while.<br><br>The surroundings, on the city center, are supposedly a dangeours place, but it seemed to be more or less like the Teatro Municipal area, in Rio, or the Teatro Castro Alves area, in Salvador, would be at night: desert and perhaps risky if you walk around careless.

If you are visiting the city of Fortaleza on a cruise ship be prepared for bus loads of passengers at the theatre and only a handful of other tourists.That aside, it was wonderful to see this showy building with a fusion of Victorian classical and Art Nouveau architecture. Our guide took us through the entry gates which is a separate structure (also beautiful) before taking us to the theatre itself.<br><br>The striking external features are the bold coloured glass windowpanes sitting atop the theatre and dominate the building from most angles. In contrast the graceful, pastel wrought iron work on the first floor balustrade, the side stairs and a much simpler wrought iron effect on the second level is a reminder of a genteel past - made in Scotland.<br><br>The inside is a ‘masterpiece’ of artwork and opulence. Look up to the ceiling that exhibits delicate, plaster frescoes &amp; figures, beautiful artwork, a painted relief above the stage and a continuation of wrought iron balustrades that encircle the seating tiers.The cane seating adds a tropical touch to an otherwise ostentatious interior and one wonders whether they would be comfortable during a performance.<br><br>Outside you can wander in the ‘formal’ garden and it was quite pleasant after the heat inside the theatre. Entry was included in our ship’s tour however, it costs around $4.00 otherwise. Restrooms are very hygienic, clean and located around from the entryway. If you are in the city centre then you can’t miss the coloured glass and theatre name from the adjacent park. Regular performances are scheduled especially at weekends – you may be lucky to be there for one.<br><br>Enjoy your experience!

I must agree with previous reviewers that this site is very badly organised and the staff lack training. However, I would not dismiss it too quickly as it is a true wonder in this very odd city. The theatre is currently undergoing restoration as it has completed 104 years of existence. This seems to me of great importance in a city that has very few cultural sites. The main room boasts a wonderful painted ceiling and for that alone it is worth a visit. Highly recommended, especially when the works are completed in June 2014 (estimated).

Our ship docked at an industrial pier about 5 miles from the city center. Shuttle buses were provided into the town where there are available taxis but only a few have A/C or English speaking drivers. We were forewarned that some issues involving criminal activity should act as a ""caution"" to be alert. We opted to take a ship's tour focusing on the local sights. An armed guard was assigned to our bus. <br><br>Following a 40 minute drive through the residential area, we arrived at the Jose de Alencar Theater located in the city's main square. Built in 1910 from a cast iron frame imported from Scotland, the theater is an eclectic mix of classic and art nouveau architecture. It must have been something in its prime when it housed many performances by noted opera personalities brought in by the wealthy residents of the city. Sad to say, it is in need of a major restoration. After traversing the busy commercial area, we made a visit to the neo-Gothic Se Cathedral with its impressive stained glass windows.<br><br>The historic Municipal Lighthouse built by slaves in the 1840's was our next stop and worthy of a visit. We got a glimpse of the Fortress of Our Lady of the Assumption which has been restored and serves as an active military installation..<br><br>We had ample time to visit the flourishing handicraft market which is housed within a former prison. Traveling back to the ship we stopped for a photo op at the English Bridge and the Iracema Beach and sand dunes.

Just off shopping street Rua Monsenhor Tabosa, is one of the most recognised national venues in Fortaleza and a must do while in the city. If you can spare a few hours (we couldn’t give it the time it deserves) there is a combination of art and culture accessible in a fairly compact area.<br><br>Keys sights include the Cearense Ceara Culture Memorial, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Theatre of the Sea Dragon, movie theatres, an amphitheatre and the Planetarium. Not a lot of English interpretive signs to explain some exhibits but the visuals were great.<br><br>The building itself is quite dramatic however the surrounding bars and restaurants are located in gaily-coloured patchwork like, colonial terraces that really catch the eye. Now filled with tourists and locals, it’s a charming representation from the past.<br><br>Getting from one section to the next you are bound to cross the red iron pedestrian bridge that reminded us of a railway crossing. If you turn around and gaze back where you came from you’ll experience the ‘perception effect’, which gives this walking corridor a surreal atmosphere – try waiting to get a photo without the crowds.<br><br>There are a few shops displaying and selling some original arts and craft - some have brilliant colours and textures. It’s also a place to explore and unwind with a coffee at one of their onsite cafes - we were so glad we spent some time in this city’s expose to culture but the centre deserves more time than we had.<br><br>Enjoy your experience!

From the outside thisc begrimed Roman-Gothic Cathedral with its twein spires dominating the surrounding arwea, and the buttresses so reminiscent of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, could understandably be mistaken for neo-Gothic and old. It is far from venerabler, however: construction of thuis edifice began in 1939, but wartime exigencies delayed completion until 1978 when it was consecrated. Inside, however, an entirely different impression emerges. The Cathedral is the third largest in Brazil and its crowning glory has to be the magnificent stained glass that leave an indelible impression. Of course the soaring ceiling and the impressive statuary tell you that you arwe in an impressive house of worship, one, moreover, that is in an established precinct of culture and history. It is a mere 500 metres or so of level walk to the Centro de Turismo and the Museo de Arte e Cultura Popular, two more attractions on the Senador Pompeu that you should not miss.

The cheering and singing began well before the game started and finished only after the game had ended. This amazed me because neither team came from within 100s of km of Brasilia. Wherever you sit in the ground, you feel very close to the action. Design of the structure is very clean and uncomplicated. A pity there are no organised tours of the stadium. If you get the opportunity to visit the stadium for any reason, take it.

The main attraction in this park are the two Mineral Pools hence the name Agua Mineral. Water is refreshing and clean since its coming in from a content flowing spring. At the time of this writing the larger of the two pools is closed for remodeling so right now only one of the pools is open. There are a couple of trails to hike on and when you get back you can cool off in the pool. I believe there is only food available on the weekends. Nice place to bring the family.

A twenty minute drive from Brasilia makes this just right for a morning or an afternoon trip - you get out of the city without having to make a day of it. The huge rock pool, fed by natural mineral water, is beautiful but often busy on holidays and weekends. The two trails are pretty but uniform - a good way to get to know the birds, trees, and butterflies of the cerrado. One trail (Capivara) is about a twenty minute walk, the other (Aguas Cristais) an hour-long, 5k walk. While the pool stays busy, the trails are peaceful and less used. Be prepared with sunscreen though - the 5k trail is high on the hill and completely exposed to the sun, so it can get warm. And try to come early in the day - as with most of of the ecological parks in Brasilia, it closes at 5pm.

It's better known for its unofficial name Água Mineral. Because it is relatively inexpensive and very close to the city, people call its pools ""the beach of Brasilia"". There's a cap on the number of visitors each day to ensure the preservation of the park, so if you must go on a weekend, be prepared to get there before 8 AM and wait in line.<br><br>There's nothing special about the pools, really. Leave it for the locals. Go for the hikes, where you can see the uniqueness of the vegetation of the Cerrado, a kind of savanah indigenous to central Brazil somewhat similar to its African cousin.<br><br>There are 2 trails: Capivara (about 15-20 minutes) and Cristal Água (1 hour). They're both really easy. Capivara is well shadowed and closer to the pool area, and it's quite busy at all times so no special precautions are needed.<br><br>For Cristal Água you should bring comfortable shoes, a bottle of water, sunscreen and a hat. However, you will have a great opportunity of enjoying silence and contact with nature, as hikers are few and far between even on the busiest days.

The greatest area of Brasilia Nacional Park can not be visited. This is a Cerrado's wildlife reserve. In the area people can visit, you have two wonderful mineral water pools.

I recomend visits only in Summer or Spring 'cause water is very cold for Winter or Fall.

We went to the Brasilia National Park in a Saturday. It mostly consisted of long walking trails, a few amongst trees but most uncovered/hot. Didn't see any wildlife. We were told there would be ""waterfalls"" at the end of one trail, and when we got there after a few miles of walking, it was more like a ""puddle."" The natural water pool that they have did seem entertaining, but wasn't sure how clean it must be so didn't go in. Also hoped for some bike rentals, but they didn't have. <br>Bring food too because there is none to purchase there. Finally, foreigners get charged 15 Real as opposed to 7-8 Real for locals.<br><br>If you're up for walking trails with not much of a view, this is your place. If not, you're not missing much.<br><br>

I have been to many football stadiums around the world, but this ranks as one of the best. Towering supporting pillars circle the outside of the arena, with a seemingly more modernised stadium within. There are huge concourses, with lots of facilities. Then, when you take your seat, you realise how close you are to the pitch. The stands are so steep that the sight lines are fantastic wherever you are positioned, and the closeness to the action is more reminiscent of an English stadium. I preferred this ground to the Maracana, which although iconic, is more of a bowl and so you are much further back from the action. The stadium is also in a great location, a park just a walk from some of the central sights of Brasilia (including the TV tower).

This place cost the people of Brasilia over 1 billion US dollars to build (for the World Cup). It is monstrously ugly on the outside.The interior is an impressive modern football stadium.

This is not one of those places people recommend just for tourists. Clube do Choro is a place we from Brasilia like a lot. It is not very fancy, nor it is expensive, it is a place you can hear really good music and drink beer. Choro is a rhythm very typical from Brazil. It is calm, yet far from being boring. It remembers samba, but it is not what you see during carnival. It is slower than that. Probably people will want to kill me, but I would say that if samba would be rock, choro would be jazz.

Don't miss going to Clube do Choro. It's a true heritage of the real and good Brazilian music. Here you will see some of the best musicians you've ever seen and fell the atmosphere of the hard work a and dedication of a legend among Brazilian artists: Mr. Henrique Filho, nicknamed ""Reco do Bandolim"", who deserves a statue as one of the greatest contrubutors of the first class universal music. For me, it's the best attraction in Brasilia.

This club offers wide range of performers, pull the schedule up online. We went twice during our stay in Brasilia. The first night, Tuesday, was sparselt attended but the music was good. Friday night's show was very popular and people got turned away. So pick up your tickets early if you want to be guaranteed a seat. It's not fancy. Folks come for the music not to see and be seen, and whenit's full it is crowded. The food is quite good and the drinks are generous. The wait staff mostly does not speak English but we managed to communicate.

The Federal Supreme Court of Brazil is at one end of Praça dos Tres Poderes (Square of the Three Powers). It was built in 1958 by the architect Oscar Niemeyer. The statue of the sitting lady was made by Alfredo Ceschiatti, a Brazilian sculptor of Italian parentage. It is called 'A Justicia' (To Justice).

This was the first official residence of president Kubitschek, the founder of Brasília, in this region. It is worth a visit if you're curious about the history of the city. It will make you think about this man's bold decision of building the capital from scratch in the middle of nothing.<br><br>That said, and despite recent efforts to renovate the structure, the museum has many conservation problems. There is no protection from sunlight in the rooms, and the original objects like books, records and other printed material have changed colors. The president's pajamas, that once were red are now as pink as the Pink Panther due to direct sunlight exposure, and will eventually turn to white, according to one staff member's prophecy. The shirt is missing in the president's tuxedo, as well as the tie in another mannequin.<br><br>Another problem is access to the place, some 20 km from ""Plano Piloto"". Probably the best way to get there is still by car, but roads are in bad shape, signs are poor and traffic is intense most of the time.

I have no interest in zoos, but I visited here primarily to do some birdwatching. The zoo is very big, and surprisingly it allows access to cars; mind you, the cars all travel very slowly. The zoo itself seem well maintained, but I was not impressed by the enclosures of the larger mammals - I never like to see mammals like this help in captivity. The zoo was busy when I visited (on a Sunday) and seems to attract many families for a day out. With the exception of the large mammals in enclosures, it is a pleasant place to visit. Anyone interested in birdwatching will enjoy the breeding colonies of egrets and storks, the black vultures, ibis and toco tucans. The day I was there I saw at least 30 different species, so it is well worth a visit. The nicest bird I saw was the red-cowled cardinal - apparently an endemic to north-east Brazil and recent introduction in a few other places. <br>One of the most enjoyable things was watching the feral cats trying to catch the feral pigeons...

I absolutly enjoy going to the Brasilia Zoo. Why? It is cheap, has lots of trees, nice walks and you get to see the animals. You can drive inside the zoo, between the different spots (you do need to get out of the car to see the animals though). I heard that recently they have a nice transportation system inside the zoo, which means less walking. Even though I walked a lot, the kids loved it. We were all very tired at the end fo the day but we had fun. This is not an amazing zoo, but more than enough to have a good time. Take a snack, even though you can buy a few things there.

Nice from the outside, but the closer you come the worse it gets. First the footpath vanished, so you just walk down with the cars to the central parking. Then the next surprise is that you cannot enter in shorts, which is quite surprising given 35oC outside and no single information about it. Also it's clearly not a mosque or church...<br><br>In general even though the tourists visits are possible it seems that they are not welcome at all. There is not much information outside and the service is rude and doesn't speak any foreign language. Left pretty bad impression to me.

I enjoy going to the zoo with my daughter, though I haven't been in over 6 months. It´s really quite wide-spread and very nice for extended walks. Animal variety is quite good and it´s clearly noticeable, by various animal births, that many of the animals like to live here and that the team is very dedicated to the wildlife. I actually think it's a must-see for families with children who come to Brasília.<br><br>But I unfortunately cannot give it a higher mark, though I admit the administration has been working on improvements to the exhibits. But, basic infrastructure, like bathrooms, really is close to disgusting. And if one expects the nice landscaping and rich information of zoos like the one in New Orleans, which is one I am used to when I travel to the US, or even Central Park Zoo in NYC or the zoo in Chicago, then one will be thoroughly disappointed.<br><br>Perhaps I've been unfair in my score, I wish great success to the Zoo, but I know in Brazil things can be done better - for example, the wonderful Bird Park by Iguçu Falls. If a touch of US zookeeping were given to this one, it would perhaps become one of the top zoos in the world - it has that potential.

The Brasilia Zoo is kind of nice, even featuring few animals compared to other zoos in big Brazilian cities, like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. You can catch a glimpse of endangered species, like the mico-leão-dourado and mico-leão-da-cara-dourada, and enjoy spaces like the butterfly vivarium. Sure the country's capital could have a bigger, better zoo, but it is a moderately fun visit. Low points are the lack of information or guides - except for school groups - and the horrible state of its pathways. People with disability will have a hard time walking around. The same goes to people with babies in strollers. Actually the place is designed to be visited hopping on and off your private car - which is anachronic if nothing else.

This is a different zoo - very roomy, you get to walk quite a lot (which may be unconfortable in July through September, when Brasilia gets extremely dry (humidity can drop to less than 10%), so make sure you bring a lot of water with you. They have lots of animals, which seem to be well kept. They could improve their restrooms and food/beverage kiosks, but otherwise it's pretty good.

Best sight in Brasilia. The best part is swimming in 5 waterfalls. The water is warm but not two warm, the pools have areas for all ages and swimming ability, you can even canyoning a bit. I would say due to the hiking between pools I would recommend minimum age of 6 but if your child likes swimming a lot I might lower that to 4. They also are rehabilitating birds, they are blue/yellow and very large. One warning not a lot of English is spoken on the tour, but its not hard to follow along. Once the tour is finish they serve lunch and have a high ropes course and animals that children would enjoy interacting with. I would recommend given 90 minutes travel time from Brasilia and any anticipated traffic. I will enjoy this tour every time I'm in Brasilia.

Just 40 minutes from downtown Brasilia, Chapada Imperial is a true hiking and diving experience within the Cerrado's original flora and fauna (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerrado). Beautiful views, hills, lakes, pits, and waterfalls. You have different options of hiking being the longest one 4 hours (about 4 km/2.5 miles). Even on your way back inside an old truck (fun!) the viewing of the horizon is absolutely gorgeous. And after all the hiking/climbing/swimming effort you are rewarded with a delicious Galinhada (rice with chicken), a traditional local dish. The hiking is always guided and the pace is for kids and the elderly.

It was a very peaceful thing to do I just wished that I had toured the adjacent building first as it gives more of the history of the temple and explains some of the aspects; such as the crystal projecting a coloured light onto the steel work at the end of the walk depending on the sunlight reflecting through it at the time of day.

They have a collection of artifacts and gifts received from various religions including Buddhism, Islam, Christianity &amp; Hinduism.<br>There is an Egyptian-themed room for meditation that comes with a fee. At the other end of the temple is a huge convention room with its ceiling tapering into a cone and a heavy crystal at its summit. Right below it on the floor is a set of black and white concentric circles. It supposes that by starting to walk step by step from one set will facilitate introspection, and walking on the other set of circles will lead to enlightenment, finally ending with a sip of the 'holy' water that collects under the crystal.

Anybody interested in triangular coned buildings should have a look at this (it is located at the rear of the main private hospital center at the south end of W3, and a stone´s throw from the huge city cemetery.

The picture is wrong. The picture shown when I wrote the review is of the Cathedral (also worth visiting). <br>At the Legião Temple they show the works of the founder of the Legião da Boa Vontade and a bit of their work on charity programs. Next to the temple there is a library and an auditorium. In the temple There are rooms for meditation and prayer. The main attraction is a spiral on he floor where you walk in direction to the center of the pyramid shaped building where, on the ceiling there is a 20-something kg pure crystal stone.

The temple exudes a vibe of good will and spirituality. All faiths and beliefs are respected and welcomed. Inside the temple which is below a seven sided pyramid like structure that holds a giant 21kg pure crystal, you can walk a spiral path of granite and reflect on your life. The temple is located a bit further away from the government buildings and architectural monuments, but it is worth the trip.

This is unescapable. First, because it is located right in the middle of the Monumental axis next to the Square of the Three Powers.

The huge botanic garden is really a slice of the savanna (called the ""Cerrado"") of the Brazilian Central Plateau.

So we've meet Cesar our guide that proceeded to show us the Middle trail (short, middle and long trails are available). With Pedro (another guide) they started guding us throug the reserve and we've started loving the trip more and more. Pure and clean watter meadows, with natural pools where you can swim, flows down besides you when you hike down the crests to the valey. Several Watterfalls are available with idylical lakes to swim. <br>The kids love it and the day was complete with a nice hike up the hill (300M up) to join Mr Antonio and his pick up to drive us back to the main house. <br><br>Trully a must see and enjoy the nature place

We had an english speaking tour of the halls which was late in the afternoon but was worthwhile as the sunset shots were great and the reflection of the towers in the pond at the back of the building are also worthwhile. The free tour takes you into the public viewing area of each Chamber, the different coloured areas the guides have a good background knowledge and it was shortly after the peaceful protests had gained world wide attention so the members were being more responsive to the public. You are provided with an information package which explains everything also. The flag behind the building was supposed to be lowered at 5pm on Friday with guards dressed in heritage uniform to a band unfortunately due to recent protests this did not occur. The flag is lowered at 6pm each night and replaced with a new flag &amp; military service on the first Sunday of each month.

Being a U.S. citizen and knowing first hand how hard it is to get into the U.S. Capitol, it was amazing to stroll into the seat of the Brazilian national government late one afternoon. No line and we passed only a metal detector and then were able to stroll around the interior waiting for a tour, which unfortunately for us was only in Portuguese. Perhaps the lack of tourists relates to the Brazilian's sense that their government is quite corrupt (see other reviews by Brazilians). Indeed there was a protest encampment across the street. <br><br>In any event we were shown inside the Senado Federal do Brasil (their senate) and also the Chamber of Deputies. These are housed in the domed and inverted domed structures that flank the two tall office buildings in the center. The architect was Oscar Niemeyer and his buildings are modern, often beautiful, and always unusual. Brasilia is a planned city said to be in the shape of a bird where the tall buildings of the Congresso Nacional are the beak. The building was constructed in the 1960s and the decor really takes you back to that time.<br><br>There was no admission cost and it was a very interesting experience that I would recommend if one likes that kind of thing.

Brasilia´s architecture is unique. It was a city planned to be the capital and it started being built back in 1958 at the esplanade center location. Further down after the ministries buildings in both sides you will see the National Congress which is near to Itamaraty - Brazilian MFA on one side and the President´s working palace on the other. And in the back side there is plaza. <br>This area is the Brazilian political center, with lots of green areas all around. One side of the Congress is the Chamber and the other is the Senate.

Cool to walk trough where the most important people of Brazil work though. <br><br>Fiz a visita guiada no Congresso Nacional em setembro de 2013 com amigos.

Visited with a tour group of 20. The access roads deteriorated the nearer we got to Chapada Imperial and although our bus journey was about an hour, it seemed longer. However, the journey is well worth it as the 3 hour walk, partly along side the stream was very enjoyable and not strenuous. Our guides swam in the pools at the base of each waterfall although it was a bit icy for us. The water was crystal clear and small fish could be seen swimming. Our guides were knowledgable and fun to be with - one led while the other became our ""tail-end Charlie"". The path is well worn and a little slippery in places. Our one disappointment was that we saw very little wildlife during our walk. There are plenty of activities available at the Chapada complex including a climbing wall, a flying fox and high level cable walkways. The people looking after these activities new what they were doing and operated all equipment in a safe manner. There were semi tame Macaws at the complex who made great photographic models. The food was not great but more than adequate. A great days activity.

For having a lake in the middle of a city, you'd think that there would be much better access - convenient places to go swimming in it (though it's muddy and not very swim-friendly). That said, it serves as a very picturesque backdrop for lots of restaurants on the lakeside, and folks enjoy watersports on the lake, and fish from muddy spots on the shore. It's just not easy to access. Also, be very wary of accessing remote public lake-side areas at dark or alone - violent crime has been reported to occur with some regularity against individuals or small groups when there is no-one around.

This articificial lake is polluted so avoid swimming or extracting fish from it.

For some, it symbolizes civic participation. For others it is the epicenter of corruption. The 100-meters (328 ft) twin towers are the tallest buildings in Brasilia.

It's not a big church, but it's a really important point and symbol of the city.

The Square of the Three Powers is one of those places visitors can come and say 'Wow, for real? Did the Jetsons live here?' <br>The Square of the Three Powers is of great importance to Brasilia and to Brazil. The 'three powers' are at a stone's throw away as the three branches of Government, Executive, Legislative and Judicial are there. A masterpiece of art made of concrete, marble, cement... and DREAMS. If you´re there before sunrise be sure that you´re going to see one of the most beautiful sunrises of your life... If you´re there to see the sunset have absolutely no doubt you´re going to see THE most beautiful sunset of your life. It does not matter when you´re there to visit... You´re going to be impressed by its grandeur.<br>Brasilia is unmissable and the Square of the Three Powers is the icing on the cake.

Take your time and look at all the detail of the different plants growing here would be my advise. There's more here than meets the eye at first glance.

Not what you expect in a Botanic Garden. Designed for motor car. Large area of bush with paths through it. No map and limited signage. Cafe in middle is nice. Near to it are recent initatives to design examples of biomes around ponds. Can get there by bus but is a long way from city centre. Trees are labelled but you need to be knowledgeable or have a guide to know the significance of what you are seeing. Some explanatory brochures in different languages and a map would be a great improvements. Only 5 BRL to enter.

First of all I must admit I know little about botany and probably didn't appreciated the delights this botanic gardens offered. The botanic gardens is located about 18km from the city centre, and it is a relatively straightforward bus ride to get within the vicinity of the entrance - I had to walk a bit over a kilometre from my bus stop to the entrance, which was a bit of an ordeal in the heat of the mid-day sun - but that was my problem. When I got to the entrance, I was told the central part of the Botanic Gardens was another 2km of a walk - again not complaining as it is nice to have such a large area for a botanic gardens, but if I had known that, I would have come better equipped to deal with the heat. But, like most everywhere else in Brasilia, this is equipped for a car, or a bike; I was on foot. <br>The long driveway was a nice walk through the Cerrado, the habitat of this area, and many of the shrubs were labelled - which is a nice touch. The main part of the botanic gardens was broken into different areas, included samples of the different habitats found in Brazil - this was the most interesting part of the Botanic Gardens to for me. The main gardens behind the restaurant was a bit incomprehensible to me, possibly because none of the information signs were in English (and I wasn't really expecting any to be!). Notwithstanding the lack of information for a non Portuguese speaker, I never felt the areas were very special - the feeling that I sometimes get in other impressive Botanical Gardens that I have visited. <br> <br>Another slight irritation is that the gardens are in the flight path to the airport, so the sound of low-flying aircraft is a constant. And when I was there, the grass in the main part of the gardens was being cut by a very noisy strimmer; and all this adjacent to the Japanese Garden of Tranquility!!<br><br>I am glad I visited the botanic gardens, but I was left feeling a bit underwhelmed by the visit.

One can take a bus to the Botanical gardens so it takes about 30 mins from the centre . I have tendency to visit botanical gardens everywhere I go - and you see and learn so much. Initially you'll have to walk about 1.5-2 km before you reach civilisation , occasional car will pass you by. You'll get the map to help you navigate at the entrance and at the end you'll see quite a bit; They have orchidario to observe orchids, japanese gardens and 'left over' of the rainforest. You may run into schoolkids that are frequently brought here for excursion / day out - but they didn't bother me at all . Small and quiet caffe can be enjoyed and you 'll be surounded by beautiful flora. I've done this around the time of the World Cup June 2014 - so it is a later review, and for me it was a wonderful escape from all the craziness

In Brasilia, there are two towers from which to get great views. This is the original and its design is in keeping with the overall 60's futuristic design of the city. Loved the big empty main enclosed floor above the entry plaza (Check out the cool tile work on the wall facing in the direction of the congress complex). The tower looks so plain and simple until you realize hey there is an outdoor floor half way up where you get great views of the monumental axis in all directions. Definitely check out the adjacent hippy crafts market...some good souvenirs there.

Want to see why Brasilia is said to be designed like a an airplane? Climb up the tv tower at the Esplanda dos Ministérios and see how the sprawling south wing (Asa Sul), north wing (Asa Norte) and the fuselage (Esplanada). A must do in Brasília. After the climb up, go down and walk around the TV tower stalls for shop and eat featuring local products and local foods and drinks. Try the pastel and the caldo de cana or if you are more adventurous try famous Tacacá (indian food) which numbs the mouth when ingested... too much and wrongly prepared, and it can be poison :) cooked just right and its delicious!

The elevator takes you up to a viewing platform about a third of the way up on this 230 meter high TV tower. From here you really get a good idea of the extent of the city's Eixo Monumental - the very long greenway that extends in both directions from the tower and contains many of the iconic Niemeyer architectural creations. It's the next best thing to a ride up one of the legs of the Eiffel Tower. Take your time and enjoy the absolute clarity of the air that allows you to see clearly for miles and miles in all directions.

It is a constitutional history lesson spelt in large letters: the congress/senate, the presidential palace and the supreme court a tripod of theoretical stability. The nearbye national flag pole made of as many pillars as states and the museum to Tiradentes rounded off by the eternal flame add to the metafor. Good for pictures of the: ""I've been there"" type.

This is another achievement of its architect Oscar Niemeyer. It is called the square of the three powers because it is where the legislative, the executive and the judiciary powers converge. On one side, the National Congress stands for the legislative. The President's Office represents the executive whereas the Supreme Court stands for the legislative. But this huge square has other interesting features: an impressive flagpole, an underground showroom dedicated to the building of Brasilia, a monument, whose interior tells the story of Brazil, a bust of President Juscelino Kubitschek and many other works of art, which have become famed landmarks in the city.

Vast expanses, breath-taking ambitions and monumental scale. But all has the menacing air of an over-powerful state in which citizens are just little cogs, a cult of government institutions with pious references to democracy but nothing more. The architecture is undoubtedly interesting but, as with all 1960s construction, crumbling, greying and depressingly authoritarian. Definitely worth a visit. But then, when you note that there are no pavements or pedestrian facilities, you may finally realise that this entire construction is about state power over power, rather than state accountability to people. A relic of a by-gone era, worth preserving, but also worth moving on.

The view from up the tower is awesome and being from Brasília helped A LOT! There are no maps, no signs pointing to the main buildings nor explaining architectural details of the city. Even finding the elevator/knowing you're able to go up there for free may not be so easy. The view is great, but I'd suggest going there on your last day here, when you would probably know the city a bit more and then would be able to recognize some of the places you've been to.<br>The tower also hosts a small market selling all types of goods - from food (from different regions of Brazil), to furniture, clothing... Nothing super luxurious, but it's worth walking around. The market is completely open on Saturdays and Sundays, on weekdays you can get something to eat/drink and some souvenirs, but that's it!<br>If you're not from Brazil, try out ""pastel de queijo com caldo de cana"" - it's a cheese stuffed and fried ""pastry"" and a sugar cane juice. It's what locals eat (maybe change the stuffing for meat) and it's DELICIOUS! <br>Advice: check if it opens on Monday, I'm not sure. :/

The square houses 3 of the most important buildings in the city: the Congress and Senate house, the Planalto Palace (the presidential office) and the Supreme Court building - each representing the 3 offices that rule the country, with their own autonomy, yet in balance and harmony. This is represented by the distribution of the buildings' construction, forming a perfect triangle. There are also some smaller buildings, like the one dedicated to the National heroes' memory and another that houses a large scale model of the city. you can visit all buildings and get a guided tour in order to learn more about the project and architecture of each building.

The Three Powers Square is the heart of Brasilia since the development of the city spread from here. It is surrounded by the National Congress, the Presidential Offices, and Supreme Court. There are several sculptures in the square in memoriam to the city's founding, an diorama of the city under the square, the giant flag pole (largest permenently flying flag in the world), and the Panteão da Pátria (a museum honoring heroes of Brazil) with a permanently lit torch on a structure looking over the square. If you are there on the first Sunday of the month at 10 am, the Brasilian military conducts a formal flag changing ceremony that rotates among the various services.

The observation platform is only about 1/3 of the way up the structure, at about 15-18 stories, but is reached by a central elevator.

We were part of a large group that visited this park for a day excursion after a three day meeting. Most people were nature lovers. This park exceeded our expectations for its beauty and interest for birders and botanists. Well worth the visit.<br><br>While it is only 50 km from Brasilia the last 10 km or so is on dirt road - a good surface but I think may be difficult after heavy rain.<br><br>There are a number of walks of different lengths but you only need to go one way as a truck can pick you up from where you stop. The long walk is an extension of the medium walk. I was in a group that started at the 'end' of the long walk. We were driven by truck to the final point and then did the long walk in reverse. The long walk travels along the water course past many waterfalls and is mostly downhill. There is a steep climb from the last waterfall up to where the truck picks you up. Doing it in reverse, we started with a steep downhill climb and then a gradual walk uphill. We had a guide to accompany us.<br><br>We had the opportunity to swim at four different falls - the water was cool and very refreshing. I took the opportunity to swim at each one, including a dunking under the falls themselves. <br><br>The walk is not really suitable for someone who is not steady on their feet or has a fear of heights. Some of the ladders/steps down to the falls were steep with the odd rung missing. I was fine (I am 63 yr old but very fit) but you do need to be reasonable active to do the long walk. Wear proper footwear, take water, a hat and sunscreen and don't forget your swimmers. <br><br>Our party of nature lovers saw a range of wildlife including tamarind monkeys, a river otter, a lot of birds and butterflies. There was a wide range of vegetation in flower. <br><br>It is a beautiful nature park - a bit rough and primitive but a real gem. The park owners are also involved in animal rescue and who should be applauded for their activities. We enjoyed a simple lunch at the end of our trip and a ride on the 'flying fox'. A great day out so close to brasilia.

We were passing the Torre de Televisão (TV Tower) walking to other sites and decided it made sense to go up and see what the view was like. From the open air observation deck, which is about 1/3 of the way up the tower, you get a beautiful 360 degree view of Brasilia which really helps you understand the layout of the city. It is also a remarkable vista where you can see as far as Lake Paranoá. More importantly, you get a sense of the bird-like shape of the planned city of Brasilia. The TV tower is on the Eixo Monumental, which is the axis (central section) of the city that is the body of the bird. You can see to the Congresso Nacional, the two tall buildings that can be thought of as the beak of the bird. <br><br>There is no cost to go up the elevator to the observation deck, but a guard at the base made everyone leave their water bottle down below. Remarkably he seemed to remember which bottle belonged to each person so were weren't without hydration!<br><br>Overall, a nice was to see the city through some very special views.

The TV Tower is a good place to have a nice view of Brasilia (if you go to the top of the tower). However, what I most like in it is the handcraft market. You can find everything there, from a simple souvenir to home furniture and also typical food. It's definetely the kind of place where you can find a bit of Brazilian soul.

Any time you see the US president, or any other head of state, in Brasilia they are usually pictured inside this building. An eyeglasses manufacturer used images of the building as representing the future. This building is the ceremonial center for the Brasilian State Department. The US doesn't really have an equivalent. There are English tours. We happened to catch one. When we arrived I asked in Portuguese whether there was a tour available. The receptionist said that there was one starting in 10 minutes but that , unfortunately, it was in English. I said there was no problem. In fact I was very happy that I would not need to translate, yeah! I have visited this building many times before and I never fail to learn something new each time. It is well worth the effort if only to take a picture of where your head of state was pictured.

How many ministries give guided tours of their own buildings? If you work in the beautiful Itamaraty Palace that houses the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, then its understandable. A proudly modern building in the 1960s, you approach via a footpath over a large pond that surrounds the front of the building. Large arches, cavernous halls, white wall to wall murals, a hanging spiral staircase and many other features make this a worthwhile stop.<br><br>I'm told there a re tours every hour on the hour but can't confirm that.

Having worked for a Brazilian Embassy abroad as a local employee, I had always wished to visit HQ. I took a guided tour in Portuguese with a very clear-speaking member of the Ministry of External Relations (Itamaraty) staff. Tours are available in English on request at set times. Our tour began at 10.00 a.m. and lasted one hour. The works of art are stunning and the indoor/outdoor tropical gardens of Burle Marx remain beautiful and well-tended. Particularly loved the movable aluminium sheet sculpture and the Metamorphosis which changes depending on the angle of vision. Beautifully airy and light and still very modern after the years.

Just turn up in working hours at the side door and you will be assigned an escort for a half-hour tour of the building, designed by Oscar Niemeyer (now over 100 years old and still working). Note the famous column-less concrete ceiling on the gound floor, the sweep of the impractical but superb staircase up to the first floor. Then admire the ""reception"" area open to the air on two sides (includes a few modern sculptures dotted around). The Palace serves basically as the office of the Foreign Minister and for important official occasions (visits by foreign dignitaries etc), while the everyday work is done in a nearby (yellow) building of no architectural merit whatsoever.

This particular market is located in central POA - which can offer other interesting places, and just because the city is probably the least Brazilian city, one feels quite at the core of the culture, even if you find imported goods as well, which makes it a place to go do your shopping once in a while.

The Public Market is one of the most beautiful places in the city. It is situated within the historic city centre, right by the Town Hall and there is a really lovely restaurante/bar next to it called Chalé da Praça XV. The Market is the best place to go for cheaper food, spices, teas and some merchandise. Whenever I need to buy nuts- cashew, walnuts-, different kinds of flower- banana, chia, linseed- or any other related products, I go there, best value for money in the city. Besides, they have the best fruit salad and ice cream combo in Porto Alegre, can't miss it. There are also some restaurants and snack bars if you want to grab a bite while there. Always a great choice to visit it.

The building was never properly restored since hit by a fire a few years ago. The second floor remains closed, and the first floor is messy and poorly lit.

The ""delicatessen"" caught my eyes and senses by the variety and quality of the products being sold: dairy, charcuterie, bread, jams, yerba mate ... Fresh fish is another wonder, with its own special alley. All mouth watering! The many restaurants and cafés are attended by locals and were quite busy during lunch hours.

To get the feel of a place, whether it's in Paris, Kyoto, or Rome, I always head straight for the market, not the supermarket, where all is covered in a plastic shroud, but the covered or outdoor market, where vendors cry out the virtues of their wares, and scents and sights tug at the nose and eyes. Porto Alegre, in the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul, is no different in this regard. In a busy city with an otherwise bland downtown, the Mercado Publico in a 19th century covered structure conjures up all the flavor and contradictions of colonial Brazil. African gods and goddesses shared shelf space and dance sultry sambas with seemingly austere Catholic saints. The scent of coffee mingles with that of miracle cures and dried cod fish bacalao.

I enjoyed strolling through and observing the many vegetables and especially tropical fruits, fishes, including many freshwater species, cooking and barbecuing implements, fresh and cured meats, spices, and the like. There are also many places to eat. Naval Restaurant is, as you might guess from the name, a seafood place, and was recommended by our hotel concierge as one of the best places in the market. We enjoyed the bacalhau do casa (house salt cod), stewed with potatoes, green beans, tomato, onions, olives, and peppers, rice and farofa on the side. Price was quite reasonable and food quality was good. Not a place I'd return purely for the food, but acceptable if you happen to be there, are hungry, and want a reliable meal.

It is worth the trouble to go downtown to spend some time in the city market.

If you are interested in fresh products (fruits and veggies), fish, meat, spices, nuts, dried fruits, cheese, cold cuts this is the place -- you will get better products for a fraction of what you will pay in regular supermarkets. If you there for fun, there is good food (fish especially), good coffee, and interesting things to see such as the variety of Ylex paraguaeinsis used to prepare Mate, or paraphernalia used in the African-Brazilian religions (candomblé, etc).

It's incredible how MERCADO PÚBLICO, or just MERCADO as we say- pronounced as mɨɾ.kˈa.du- can make you hungry just in a walk! Also you me find some some afro-brazilian religious stores, fish stores, meat stores, spices and delicacies stores and some traditionalist things that's our routine: It's not uncommon you find stores selling 'gaúcho's bowl' (the CUIA), 'bomb's chimarrão' (the BOMBA DE CHIMARRÃO- that's a straw we use to drink Chimarrão), traditionalist wear (here you may hear PRENDA (girl) and GAÚCHO/GAUDÉRIO (man)- try to find out on google, there you may search for ""rio grande do sul"", ""ctg"" and also ""fandango"". At MERCADO is so common to see people buyIng ERVA MATE like in US you see someone buying a Coke or some fries! The ERVA MATE is the most important thing to do the CHIMARRÃO. It's a rustic tea, pretty similar to green tea, white tea, but It's thicker and harder! Chimarrão is very close to a drink done in Paraguay, the TERERÊ. But the difference is that in RIO GRANDE DO SUL the chimarrão is made with ERVA MATE and tererê made of RUEDA DE TERERÊ. Uppstairs, you can enjoy some exotic restaurants and some tradicional ones that are awsome, If you have time enough try it out! This is a very simple and quick review from what you may find out there, I may spent a month talking about it, but It's an experience that every single tourist should have!

I am suspicious to talk about the Mercado since it's part of generations in my family. There are several reasons to visit. Initially because of the beautiful construction - being repaired due to a small fire a few months ago, but also to see a lot of people that buy specialties that you only find there, specially if you like cooking. Finally, there are 3 of my prefered spots there: Café do Mercado cafeteria, Gambrinus - one of the oldest restaurants in town and the ice cream with fruits (called ""Bomba"") served on the side of the food stores. If you are the kind of tourist that enjoys seen the way of living of real people, it is a must.

This seemed to be one of the popular free places to visit in Porto Alegre and also it appealed to my foodie side. It's not really hard to find being one of the focal points of the city centre and one of the largest by footprint if not height. It's slap bang next to Chale de Praca XV and right in the middle of town. The ground floor has all the masses of pork products you expect in a Portuguese or Spanish influenced market, bacalhau (salt cod) and masses of herbs and veg. On the upper deck are few restaurants including Japanese. Apparently there is a huge Japanese / Brazilian immigrant population in Brazil, a fact played out by the amount of Japanese influenced restaurants. Do visit Stall 40 for apparently the best ice cream in Porto Alegre.

JK Bridge is a 1200 metre long steel and concrete bridge crossing Lake Paranoa. The bridge was completed in 2002 and is probably best viewed either from the eastern shore of the lake or by driving over the bridge. The bridge decks are suspended by steel cables alternating at each side of the bridge-this gives the bridge its unique look. The bridge has a pedestrian walkway and is accessible to pedestrians and cyclists. The JK Bridge was awarded the Gustav Lindenthal Medal for the bridge's project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in Pittsburg, U.S.A. It is well worth a look.

Almost all achitects want to design a bridge before they die and Alexandre Chan came up with a wonderful design with the collaboration of Mario Verde the structural engineer. It dominates the lake and the views are spectacular. As a sailor I can say it looks as good from the water as it does from the land, but perhaps It's three arches are overpowering and diminish the natural beauty of the lake. It can be seen from almost every where and has added much convenience to travel with a comensurate bump in real estate prices to those living in the quadras near bye in lago sul. Now the open question is :can the government come up with the cash to keep it repaired and painted as it ages.

I am not a Brasilian taxpayer so I can't really complain - but I felt offended about the way visitors are treated. Monuments are widely advertised (some times even boisterously) but many are closed to the public without any publicity. Famous churches are closed even during the hours stated on their doors. The fact that Itamaraty is closed was stated to us (in portugese) by 4 persons (that staffed the entrance on a Saturday morning) without any additional explanation. The tour company offering a tour that we booked later was also unaware of the ""no visitantes"" status. A slimple announcement in English on the entrance including the reason would have had me accept it as normal behavior but the way it is done is offensive!

We sat on QI 23 on the hilltop with a great view of JK bridge at 11:45 pm. All around us were people in cars with champagne. The 3 loops of the bridge glowed in the night sky and the Fireworks at midnight New Years Eve were spectacular! They glimmered on the water and made the JK look like a Hollywood movie. As a bonus, fireworks went off all along the Paranoa Lake around the bridge. A memorable sight! I don't know if you can stand on the bridge at midnight New Years are but parking below gave a better view. <br><br>We paddle board below the JK bridge routinely and there are rental places for windsurfing and Stand up Paddleboarding and kayaking by the hour..most around $15 for 1 1/2 hours.

A former Swampland on the outskirts of the city (used mostly to congregate cows pre slaughtering) it was donated to the city in 1807, becoming a park officially in 1935 with design by a French architect, Monsieur Agache. The city grew up, the limits expanded, today it is a quite big and beautiful urban park close to the CBD of Porto Alegre. Surrounded by busy and happy bohemian neighbourhoods (Cidade Baixa, Bom Fim ) the park has many attractions - a famous Saturdays artsy flea market since the 80's (Brique da Redencao) , an auditorium for shows and concerts, a lake where you can feed eternally starving fish, fountains, a mini zoo, a lot of green spaces.

I walked around this park with my one-year-old daughter for the better part of an afternoon last week, and we really enjoyed it. The park is really big and completely open and flat, with a number of natural dirt trails and a few concrete ones. There were a number of older folks and families sitting on benches, as well as some university-aged kids sitting around on the grass. There is a small orchid garden that is run by a couple gardeners that are very friendly. Their facilities are somewhat dilapidated, and would probably benefit from a budget increase in the near term. There are a few folks with carts selling snacks and sodas and such, and a lake where you can rent a pedal boat shaped like a swan.<br><br>There are a handful of negatives. There were a few people smoking weed in the more isolated parts of the park. There is also an area where there are folks who seem to be living out of shopping carts filled with their belongings, also in a more isolated part of the park. Also, there is this giant rectangular pool in the middle of the park that has stagnant water where swarms of fleas congregate in groups that hang around right at head-level, and every now and again, you walk through one of these columns of fleas and it is not so pleasant.<br><br>Bottom line, I feel safe being in this park in the daytime.

It's a place for all ages and many different activities. But you have to be open-minded and not very upper class to enjoy it.

I spent an afternoon here with my one-year-old daughter. We really enjoyed this park, and it's a much nicer park than the nearby Farroupilha Park. There are a number of wide dirt paths that lead you around the park. The paths are well-maintained and were very clean on the day that we were there. There is a nice little play area for small children with a number of different swings, see-saws and such. A small lake in the middle of the park has ducks, geese and other waterfowl darting about. A terraced area of the park offers some nice views of the surrounding neighborhood and has a tall, modern sculpture that reminded me a little of Man Walking by Giacometti, only really big. We got caught in a giant rain storm in the middle of the park, and sought refuge in a bathroom under the terraces.

It was my first visit to Casa de Cultura Mario Quintana in downtown Porto Alegre. The former Majestic Hotel is so impregnated of culture and tradition that it is impossible to do not fall in love with this great complex. Take the lift, go straight to the top floor and start - slowly - going down, visiting the different spaces and galleries. You'll be surprised and extremely rewarded. Take a look at the original hotel room where legendary poet Mario Quintana lived almost all his life. And finally, visit Elis Regina's collection. The "" gaúcho"" singer was another legend in the Brazilian song scene. One last remark: Casa de Cultura Mario Quintana is undergoing an important renovation effort, but its doors are opened to the public and you are more than welcome. Enjoy!

It was interesting that this was one of the most highly rated attractions in Porto Alegre on TripAdvisor. One would not usually expect to see a city park in this position.<br><br>To be honest, this relatively small park was not anything unusual to see from the perspective of a tourist. On the other hand, I can see the allure of this popular park to the residents of this attractive Porto Alegre neighborhood. I agree with a previous reviewer who characterized this park as simple but having a magnetic appeal. This is a great park for just hanging out on a weekend. I found it to be clean and quite safe. When I was there, it was a beautiful day and there were plenty of joggers, bikers, walkers, parents watching their kids play, owners walking their dogs and people just sitting in the sun enjoying the pleasant temperatures. The aroma of popcorn from the vendors scattered through the park filled the air to help make it a fun place to be.<br><br>The two ponds were particularly fun as there was an island on one where the birds congregated. There were also lots of turtles including a couple that decided to cross the walking paths. There was also an interesting iron sculpture in the corner of the park created by Brazilian sculptor Carlos Tenius.<br><br>Overall, this park is a very pleasant spot to spend some time. It is a great place to relax or take a walk or go for a run.

while on expat assignment in POA, we lived in the neighborhood. We walked 2 blocks to get to this park. We were very fortunate to have this venue so close. Great walking/jogging paths. Great people watching. Quite busy most of the time... albeit, always very calm and comfortable. Good juice bars, coffee shops, cafes, restaurants around the park. The windmill and pond are fun... but as another reviewer commented.... this is not a tourist destination... rather, a very nice park for locals.

Moinhos do Vento is where the Upper-Class of Porto Alegre live, shop, work out, pass time and everything the Upper-Class do. The bars are without a doubt the best in Porto Alegre, if not a little expensive for the average Brazilian, but they do have the most diverse beers and wines, both local and imported. A business trip to Porto Alegre is perfectly staged here. It shows culture, creativity, diversity and most of all ambition. Porto alegre has the best quality of life within Brazil and this is the European mans/womans perfect representation of South-America. The streets, parks, beaty salons, schools, universities and shopping centres are all close by and Moinhos is relatively central making transport exremely simple.

One of the larger lakes has paddleboats. Bicycles can be rented. There is a ""tremzinho"" doing a tour. Around the Park, at Rua Jose Bonifacio, where is the Military College, a school whose students have the best performances of the entire state, on Saturday mornings there is a fair of organic products and in the afternoon, starts the ""brique"" divided between the part of the tents of crafts and rare antique materials. The Brique continues during the day Sunday when one of street lanes is closed to vehicular traffic. Nese place to see everything from the exotic perfosmistas goers.<br>At the confluence of the avenues Jose Bonifacio and Aranha, there is a mini-market type building with feeding sites and selling garden products and pets. Crossing Avenida Jose Bonifacio, we found two igrajas on the same block where is the HPS - place where you should go if you have any health emergency because you will be treated better (in terms of Brazil) than almost anywhere else.

It was one of the nicest places of its type I have ever visited.<br><br>I walked from my hotel and found the pedestrian entrance (same as vehicle entrance) on Av. Sen. Tarso Dutra. After paying the nominal $5 Rs entry fee, I entered the park. The gorgeous day facilitated a wonderful time. It was understandably a bit busy that day but it took nothing away from the experience. The park itself provided several walking paths for strolls through a wonderful array of vegetation. There were sections for various types of trees and plants and several were labeled. There was also a Natural History Museum that contained some fun displays though it was mostly geared toward kids. I spent most of my time strolling around the various paths with occasional breaks to sit and relax.<br><br>Overall, this is a great place to spend a day outdoors.

We were lucky enough to catch two exhibitions as well as visit the CCBB's museum which has an exhibition on the history of the bank. One of the exhibitions was of contemporary Brazilian art and the other a marvellous retrospective of Cicero Dias, the Brazilian artist who spent most of his working life in Paris. Although the Cultural Centre is not so central it is fairly easy to get to and entrance is free. The Centre also has places to eat as well as ample parking space. Reserve a whole morning or afternoon.

This memorial was a 25 minute walk from our hotel. It is an interesting place to visit for a foreigner as it gives some interesting cultural insight. The memorial looks like a tall edifice with a statue on top. It is actually a museum that is mostly below ground. It is a memorial to the man credited at being the 'father' of modern Brazil. It is a homage to the man and his wife. Brasilia took form and was built during his term as president. The building of the city stimulated economic development in Brazil and also provided focus for national pride. <br><br>The memorial is very modern and provides some insight into the construction of the city. Perhaps more relevant to Brazilians, but still an interesting place to go - perhaps not the most dispassionate or balanced view of the President's achievements but by any standards he was a great man in the development of modern Brazil.<br><br>Don't have the coffee at the cafe - my blood sugar level is still recovering.

Being Dutch I was positive surprized to find out that an exhibition of Mondriaan was held in this museum so, although it is a bit remote from the center, I went there with the free bus (painted in Mondriaan style), which leaves from the central busstation. The museum entry is also free and it is allowed to make pictures (without flash of course), which is never allowed in Holland. For the occasion they also painted the ancilliary building in Mondriaan style and it was possible to make a picture of yourself in a Mondriaan painting. On top of everything, also creations of Rietveld were presented. It was a very nice afternoon.

The Metropolitan Cathedral in Brasilia is a wonderful building. It is small on the outside and does not dominate the Ministry buildings tô one side. Church should not dominate state, its communist architect Oscar Niermeyer believed. It forms part of a cultural complex of buildings including the national gallery - a Saturn like building - and the National Library. There it stands as a crown of thorns, reminding of the suffering of the poor in Brazil. But you go in and you see its spaciousness as much of it is below ground level. It is light, airy with angels descending to announce the divine in the midst of the congregation of the people. Hope is present. It's stained glass was done by Marianne Peretti a French Brazilian artist. She solved the practical problem of the cathedral being too hot and delivered a swirling pattern reminding one of primordial oceans, creation, and birth in the form of an egg shape which also reminds of the Eucharist and presence of Jesus as believed by Roman Catholic Christians.

Just spectacular...truly a brilliant building complex. Didn't know about the white flat stone looking edifice adjacent to the basilica and realized that the three building elements ( the basilica, the bell tower and this flat white circular building) represent Jesus's crown of thorns ( the basilica), the communion cup/Jesus's blood (the bell tower) and the communion wafer (this flat white element which I found out was the roof of the baptism room). You enter via a tunnel to the complex and the moment you enter the basilica, it takes your breath away. The soaring white ribs, the stained glass and the three suspended Angels truly are a sight to be hold. Just beware of the hawkers onside the front doors and the uneven hardscape plaza all around the complex. Well done, Oscar!

Don't miss this interesting free museum. We spent an hour, 2-3 pm, perusing Chao de Flores and Leon Ferrari's exhibits at the CCBB. Flores is a photojournalist and has taken photos from all over central Brazil. Her framed life size photos are breathtaking. It's easy to catch a real glimpse of Brazil through her artistic eye. At the other end of the museum is Argentine artist Ferrari's work: Resistance and transgressions. He is featured at the Moma in NY. This exhibit is not for children as there are nude drawings in each of the display cases. His work was banned by the catholic church due to its symbolic sexual drawings juxtaposed next to the Madonna and Son. (Hence the "" Transgression"" in the title.). However, his drawings on the walls are very interesting with groups of people all walking in different directions and no one is connecting. <br>There are also movies available and a cafe to sit and get refreshed. Nearby at the lake are many restaurant like 348 and Mangai. The artists do change and it's never the same place twice. Spend an enjoyable afternoon here.

At the Memorial you will find unique pictures of Brasilia and the history of Brasil. JK's personal belongings and pictures are there as well. In fact, JK himself is kept in a coffin there. Some argue that JK had a mystical side to him. He believed to be the reincarnation of a Pharaoh...either this is true or not I am not sure.

I had read much about the Catholic Catedral Metropolitana, so just had to see it at first hand. From the approach the design is special, and quirky. The wide open vista of its setting does kind of dwarf the cathedral, and this is not helped by the slew of buses, cars, taxis and street seller in the immediate surroundings. So my arrival to the building was rather spoiled, however, that changed when I entered the building. The bright sweeping stained-glass windows and wide open space is magnificent, and everything about the building is clean. A beautiful contemporary building, fitting for a house of worship.

The beauty of the building is evident as you approach.

The Cathedral is one of Brasilia’s strong points, a Niemeyer original, with glass work and decorations form Italian sculptors. Is has a curious acoustic feature due to its round shape: if you place yourself at one point with your ears close to the walls, you can listen to someone talk if placed at the other extreme end. Try with a traveling friend and have them even whisper, you still will hear what they say. This is due to the angle of the diameter of the round shape of the church.

Besides being a wonderful piece of modern architecture, the Catedral offers amazing effects of light through the tainted glass panels, especially nearly sundown time. The round shape allows people to whisper in one side and be heard far away, or receive back the echo of ones voice.

Visiting the city of Brasilia is a venture and it surely provides an opportunity to see some new interpretations of how a capital should look like if you were to create it from nothing in the middle of a country... Brasilia is a beautiful city with a young history, built in the form of an airplane - it did remind me of the DC Mall in a way, be it that on the DCMall there's the Smithsonian whereas in the Brasilia DF Mall contains the government buildings. The Cathedral is it misplaced in the midst of these concrete buildings but a welcome place in town. <br>Great internal - go visit it and experience the marvellous acoustics and light play during mass. It is magical... enjoy!

As you pass by the tall haunting statues of the four Disciples, you descend underground into cathedral. Entering the cathedral, the light from the huge domed ceiling of wavy stained glass creates an amazing effect. Hanging from the ceiling are 3 aluminum angels flying over the sanctuary. It is also interesting to see the original wooden cross of Brasilia. My only complaint is of the street vendors who hawk their wares along the entrance to the cathedral. It is reminiscent of the money changers and sellers of doves at the Temple.

This Cathedral is a unique experience as it's almost nothing you have ever seen. The Windows and Sculptures are amazing art pieces as well as is the building. Must go inside and look up as it's forbidden to build any high buildings close to the cathedral to clear the view from the windows.

These buildings are in a very nice region of the city, in an open area, full of green and nice places to sit outside. There's also a nice cafe. However, unless there is a good exposition going on, there's not much to do. It's nice to go there with kids on a sunday afternoon for them to play around, but that's pretty much it.

There are periods when it's in-between special exhibitions, when it`s still very nice to visit, but not so much as when it's got itinerary showings. But when there is an exhibit, like the very recent one on India, this ""for free"" museum is best in town, hands-down. <br><br>All exhibits I've seen over last 4 or 5 years have been of the highest quality, using all available areas very intelligently. The grounds (though a small part is in maintenance) are wonderful for kids to play in - there are some permanent ""sculptures"" which are essentially playground toys. There are good quality options for eating - though the little café did raise its price to a little more than I think is attractive.<br><br>This also is a location for good free theaters for kids and movie festivals. But one frequently needs to get there quite early for these, as they are no longer very secret, as they used to be some years ago. The theater itself has very good seats and the public feels very close to the performers.<br><br>And though it is a bit out of the way, there is a regular bus service to the hotels which, as far as I remember (I've used it once, though I live in Brasília and usually go by car), works like clockwork.

Juscelino Kubitschek (JK) was the Brazilian president, who prompted the birth of a new capital for Brazil. Salvador de Bahia was the first colonial capital until Rio de Janeiro became the 2nd capital. But in order to push more development in the centre of the country, there was a will to get a new capital located more centrally within Brazil. One day, in the late 50s, he came to see his friend, the architect Oscar Niemeyer. He shared his vision with Oscar Niemeyer and Lucio Costa was associated to the building of a new capital that was born in the 60s. This monument is therefore a testimony in honor of the man, whose vision led to the construction of the new capital.

The whole place had a very creepy feel. Obviously the city and the people worship Kubitschek - and I don't mean admire I mean worship - but there really is nothing interesting in the museum. And the fact that the guy is buried in his own museum to me is really bizarre. I would take a pass.

This is well worth a visit. JK was the founder/inspirational force of Brasilia. We are still paying for it through our taxes. The atmosphere of the memorial is a bit lugubrious, as befits a tomb (and smells of room freshener) but it contains mementos and other stuff about JK, including his and his wife´s clothes, and is lovingly cared for, I think by his daughter (and the State).

Juscelino Kubitschek, or JK, as Brazilians friendly call him, was the President who dreamt of Brasilia, seeing the importance of moving the Capital from ancient and huge Rio de Janeiro to an entirely new town, in the middle of Brazil... and of nothing! Built in an incredibly quick time, this city probably gave a transcendental turn in this Country`s history. Nevertheless, JK was banned and attacked during the military dictatorship. Finally vindicated, Brazil erected this imposing modern mausoleum for this great political man.

An somewhat interesting, modernistic privately-run memorial (R$5 entrance), though the emphasis is on photos and momentos of Kitschek's life, and his push to have Brasilia built, aimed at those who know his story. It is not a place for foreigners to learn about him for example. And since it is a private, family memoril, its purpose is to honor his memory, not to tell the story in an objective manner (e.g., no stories about the allegationsof corruption). All of those working there seemed to be dressed all in white, even with white shoes. Reminded me of a movie about a religious cult. While it won't give you the full story of Kubitschek and the buiding of Brasilia by any means, it might inspire you to read more about both.

With its arched columns joined by stained glass, reminiscent of the time of the offering in the Catholic celebrations, the image already evokes a higher spirit even before entering. The entrance is through a dark tunnel, so that when you enter, it's like flood light. The stained glass windows make its effect. The interior is simple, autero. The highlight is with the angels on the ceiling.They seem to move in ascension into heaven. Personally I also like the chapel, underground, very dark and stimulating reflection and prayer.<br><br>Com suas colunas arqueadas unidas por vitrais, que lembram o momento da oferenda nas celebrações católica,a imagem já evoca um espirito mais elevado antes mesmo de entrar.

You don't have to be a catholic to appreciate a visit to this place. The four statues of the Evangelists on the outside are wonderful, but if you have a chance enter the church by the small door beneath the main entrance - ask the taxi drive to drop you on the door brides use on their wedding day; you will have to walk a long and dark corridor, and your eyes will get used to the dark. This will add to the amazing experience of light and space when you reach the church itself. Its architecture is exquisite and the grandiosity of the space overwhelms everyone. Walk around the main nave and down the stairs behind the altar so see a small chapel, which is very peaceful and to which very few tourists go. Split your group and put your ear very close to the wall, while the other party whispers anything on the other side of the church - the amazing acoustics lets you have a conversation just by whispering from afar.

The Memorial JK mixes some former Brazilian president Juscelino Kubitschek memorabilia with photos and information on Brasilia's 56 year history, plus JK's mausoleum. It's one of the few paid attractions in the city, but at R$ 10 (less than US$ 3), it is well worth the visit. Unfortunately, opening days are uncertain - it is closed on many holidays when the city get actual tourists (and not business visits).

To get a better understanding of the history of Brasilia and how it came to being, this is a must place to start your city tour. Actually the memorial is located on the crest of the hill overlooking downtown and the Congress so you start here and work your way down the hill on the one-way boulevard. President Kubitschek was truly a great charismatic leader who was a wheeler dealer and compromiser with a determined and forceful personality. Take your time touring this important museum.

The achitecture is very different as in all these area in the center of Brasilia what was planned and build when the city was founded. Due to the roof that is all with crystal the ambient is nice because there is a lot of light inside. The acustic is also good. The only problem is the lack of parking space next to the catedral.

A Roman Catholic cathedral that serves Brasilia. The cathedral was designed by Oscar Niemeyer and construction began in 1958. For various reasons the cathedral was not completed until 1970. This ultra modern design still looks great after 50 years. Access to the cathedral is through a dark tunnel. Inside there is an amazing stained glass roof with three angels hung by steel wires from the roof structure. There are also a number of other features worth a visit by themselves.

Unfortunately, I don't think it's easy to get there by public transport (due to waiting at about 30 minutes), although there are buses that pass in front of this park and come from the main bus station. Take some time to walk along the lake shore, it is worth because of the great landscape and the nice view (best at sunset). There are good options of restaurants and bars both day and night, but do not expect a cheap account. You are in Lago Sul, a high-class neighborhood.

It's not rare to find brides and teenagers taking photos out there. It doesn't matter if you're alone, with family or friends to come here just check if it's not raining, otherwise it gets boring.

We enjoyed a pleasant walk around Lake Paranoa and then savoured a caipirinha with friends at an outdoor cafe while listening to Brazilian music. There were lots of families and groups of friends milling around the lake enjoying the mild evening. The tropical setting and the beautiful night sky gave the lake and park a most magical feel.

The BBCC is not only an excellent museum to enjoy well curated arts exhibitions but also is a great place for lunch or some family events on the generous grounds of this cultural center (picnics or night parties). There is even a regular bus shuttle to take you from / to the city center. The CCBB is located in an isolated site (sadly a general feature of most of Brasilia brutal / 1960s car-focused so-called urban 'planning' !).

Brasilia does not have many areas to stroll safely and happily as a tourist in the evening, but this park is a good exception.

Like the rest of the monuments in Brasilia - this is quite futuristic but it is stunning in its own right. It was originally commissioned to be a secular building for all faiths however the government ran out of money (no surprises) and the Catholic Church (who has lots of money) took over finishing it which is why it appears to be a government church (while Brazil is supposedly secular). You will walk in and be amazed by this modern take of a church.

This is another masterpiece of Oscar Niemeyer designed in the late 60s. It is a symbol for Christ's thorn crown. The bronze statues by Dante Croce represent the Four Evangelists.

I live in Brasilia and i go very often to the Cathedral.<br>Its architecture is the most impressive attraction, but it is a quiet and peace place. Outside, you'll be able to see four big statues of St. John, St. Matthew, St. Mark and St. Luke. Inside the church, you will see some pieces of art, like a Michelangelo's Pieta replica, the cross used in the first mass of Brasilia, during its construction, some tiles painted by Athos Bulcao and three bronze angels, hanging from the ceiling.<br>Make sure to visit the cathedral away from mass hours, if you want to go inside and take pictures.

Even the most casual student of Brazilian architecture will have no trouble identifying this cathedral as one of Oscar Niemeyer's designs. From the outside, it doesn't look particularly majestic or inspiring, but once you pass the souvenir and coconut water vendors and make your way down the ramp, you will find yourself transported. The photographs others have posted provide just a glimpse of how very, very ingenious the design is. The stained glass roof and massive ""floating"" angels are incredible, and the replica of Michelangelo's Pieta is just lovely.

This working Roman Catholic cathedral takes your breath away. Even with the weekend crowds and vendors selling ""pipoca"" (popcorn) and water around the evangelists out front, it is worth a visit during the day and revisit at night to see it lit up. Inside, the cathedral, blue and green stain glass is breathtaking. While Modernist architecture is not my thing, Niemeyer is a genius. This crown cathedral he created is stunning. The piece de resistance is the Vatican copy of Michaelangelo's Pieta of Mary holding Christ. This is behind glass at the Vatican but here you can get right up to it to see Michealangelo's genius. <br><br>You can ride these orange city bikes for free for an hour (download the ap) and there is a parking slot right outside the cathedral.

If not for anything else, anybody touring Brasilia must visit this place at least for its spectacular glasswork and architecture. Its a very non-conventional looking work for a cathedral, and that is one of its many USPs. The church itself is below ground level and what forms the ceiling of the cathedral is what you see on the exterior. Another particularly unique feature is the side-wall inside - sound travels from one end of it to the other at the usual speed. So if you have one person on one end of the wall and you on the other, you both can have a normal conversation without having to scream across the room!<br>The man-made cherubs inside seemed a bit tacky though. I really wonder if that was Niemeyer's idea..

This is the most modern Cathedral I have ever seen. The stain glass is beautiful from the inside. We went to a Portuguese mass there on Sunday that lasted 90 minutes. Visitors cannot enter will a mass is in progress. On Sunday's they are at 0800, 1030, and 1800. I think its worth a stop.

The cathedral was designed by Oscar Niemeyer, the same architect who planned and developed the city of Brasilia. It is quite modern and simple compared to cathedrals of old.<br><br>Outside the cathedral is a big square, with four 10-ft. tall bronze sculptures representing the four Evangelists, guarding the entrance. To the right is a tall bell tower containing four large bells.<br><br>From the outside, the cathedral does not look big. But it is below ground and there is also another chapel below the main altar. I thought at first that the exterior design is trying to depict a crown, but the ten columns actually represent two hands moving upwards to heaven.<br><br>Don't miss the oval-shaped baptistry to the left of the cathedral. Also you won't be able to take pictures inside, when mass is being celebrated, usually around 5 pm.

I absolutely love this place. It is a great escape, very close to the city center of Brasília but gives you a cosy, luxurious and romantic feeling at the same time. Lots of restaurant and live music on the weekends. Very different from any other spot and the beautiful lake of Parana makes you think your by the coast. During the day it is possible to do water activities. You can come here at any time but I would recommend the sunset which is outstanding. The sky together with the sun going down becomes fantastic from this site and it is a must if you are visiting Brasília.

We were there three times during World Cup 2014. Never was open even though hours were posted as open. We could see through a crack in the closed doors and it looked beautiful inside. However, if you can't get in, I wouldn't waste time going there. Kind of dumpy right around the cathedral. Certainly interesting architecture, but there was nothing there that I would recommend a trip to Brasilia to see. We were there for two games at the national stadium (which is an excellent stadium) but thought 1 day in Brasilia was plenty and wouldn't recommend it as a destination if it weren't for the games.

Inside, between some determined spots you can talk to someone lowering your voice and you will be heard. Unfortunately the Capital was built for 300 000 residents but it´s now over 1 million. Nevertheless, the residential areas still respect construction rules. Every residential block, contains an maximum of 12 buildings each one with 6 floors, all addresses are identified by numbers and letters.

The outside of the cathedral is very photogenic especially set against the bright blue sky. The cathedral bells and the statues at the entrance add to the feeling that you are in a dream world. Inside the cathedral, statues of angels are suspended against the backdrop of blue stained glass. This is a great place to reflect on the beautiful things human beings are capable of creating. Thank you Oscar Niemeyer.

The Cathedral is a must see in Brasília. Don't be discouraged by its relatively simple and a little run down exterior. Go in and you won't regret it. The angels suspended inside, the vast white space, the stained windows, and mostly, the light captured inside must be seen to be believed. Go in the early hours of the morning, if you can.

Pontão is somewhat diferent from everything in Brasilia. It's a sort of villa-looking comercial enterprise, with that well-beeing proposal kind-of-thing. Been there quite a few times with friends.<br>It does look beautiful (you can see some bride photography session going on early morning or just in the afternoon), with a special aid of Brasilia's Paranoá Lake just around, but I do feel it as something a bit fake, as it has not got this Brasilia mood or looks.<br>You can find nice restaurants, cafés or just wander arround checking socialites' speed boats parking on it's floating pier. Prices may run a bit high. It may be a good place to end a busy day, just having some drinks and a nice meal.

Certainly nice architecture. The inside is very nice also. I loved the angels going to the ceiling. I was there just before Christmas so they also had some nice Christmas displays.

Personally, this is too american wannabee to bother about it on any kind of regular basis. It is good for meeting friends to start the weekend off(read meet market). The restaurants have gone from a novelty setting , to over priced busy and loud. The real attraction is the sunset view and the occasional excellent jazz musicians/ groups. Occasionally there will be specialty markets, handicrafts expositions etc to give a specific focus for a visit.<br><br>You can have this experience in almost any large city on a body of water and it feels so similar that you will have difficulty trying to recall how it is different from so many other cities you have visited. That said, tourists seem to like it because it gives a good feel of the lake without being invited to one of the private clubs. Perhaps the traveling middle class get comfort from the idea that we have one too. <br><br>Have a beer by all means, snap a picture, nibble on something and then get out of there to see some of the real attractions of Brasilia.

Pontao is still one of the few places in Brasilia to walk around the lake and lose yourself in the moment for a while. It has one of the best landscaping infrastructure of Brasilia, offering various restaurants and bars around the lake.

For residents it is not a problem (since you need a car in Brasilia for everything!) but for tourists, you don't rent a car, you will need to get a cab, and it might be cheap.<br>Pontao has also many outdoors shows depending on the season of the year... one more attractive for this place.<br>It closes at 2am... so if you plan to walk around at night (it is nice to walk around after-hours).. remember that!<br>Although it is a public area, it is managed by a private company, which means more security, but also a few restrictions when it comes to taking pictures. It is not forbidden, but once in a while a guard might complain.<br><br>Summarizing, it is one of the most enjoyable places in Brasilia, scenery wise and relaxing wise. Great restaurants (not cheap though but various options), and definitely a place to visit in your stay in Brasilia. Lunch hours are nice too.. especially with the scenery.<br><br>It is good for families, couples, friends and everyone, although not many teenagers are here.

In my fifth time in Brasília, I finally got to visit the Cathedral. After a long period of reform for the city's 50th anniversary celebrations, during which the building was closed for visitors, It reopened late 2010 (restorations are delayed and still underway). Since I had plenty of time until my afternoon business meeting, I went there to check it out.<br><br>Brasília itself is a wonderful living open-air museum of modernist architecture, signed by the worldwide famous Oscar Niemeyer (architect) and Lucio Costa (urbanist).<br><br>If the urban planning is controversial for its empty spaces and challenges imposed to pedestrians, and many of the buildings are criticized for being too flat, the Cathedral is an undisputed masterpiece.<br><br>From the outside, it resembles a crown (of thorns?) and inside its fantastic glassworks are more visible and filter the sunlight in a spetacular way. The lack of columns on the inside and the round form make its acoustic almost perfect.<br><br>The temple itself (banks, althars, corridors) are a few feet underground, and what you can see from the outside is the upper part of the building, closer to the roof.<br><br>Only one thing seems out of place: the souvenir sellers are not in a proper place, but mixed with the four evangelists (Mathew, Mark, Luke and John) statues on the outside, making it almost impossible to take a nice picture of them.<br><br>People say it resembles Liverpoool Metropolitan Cathedral, but, if it was an inspiration (possibly it was), Niemeyer improved and perfected its concept to create Brasilia's Cathedral.<br><br>Brasília's Metropolitan Cathedral is as important, in its modernist style, as the Cologne Cathedral is for gothic or Saint Peter's Basilica is for renaissance.

The Brazilia's "" Catedral Metropolitana"" is a beautiful building with a surprising interior.<br>There are three beautiful sculpted angels hanging on the ceiling and good acoustics on the curved walls: one can speak very low at one end of the place to a person at the oposite spot . Children usually love this.<br>Near the cathedral, there are some flower stalls. This is also worth seeing. The flowers are made with natural materials and are realy enticing. The vendors are congenial and show you how the flowers are crafted.<br>Try to go there on the weekend; it's quieter and easier to park the car.<br>Don't be distracted by the people selling cheap stones in front of the cathedral. Those stones aren't valuable as they claim. Just keep walking and go directly to the building.<br>The visit will take you twenty minutes for the cathedral and fifteen minutes for the flowers.

Technically the Guaiba is not a lake or a river (although locals do refer to it as a river): it is the estuary (conjunction of several rivers) of 8 other rivers that ends in the great lagoon of ducks (Lagoa dos Patos) and finally reaches the sea. The beauty of this estuary is that the land surrounding it is very flat which leads to unimaginable sunsets. And there are huge green areas i a park that extends itself for miles along the river (estuary) side. If you like to be outside and practice some type of sport this is a great place to go.

It's undeniable the sunset beauty, consider by many as been one of the most astonished sunset in the whole country. <br>The contact with the nature, green parks close to the river makes the visit pleasent and active. Marinha park is a massive green area, peaceful and enjoyable. Running pathways and bike roads helps you to keep you fit around the coast too. <br>There's also the Gasometro museum, Ibere Camargo Museum and Beira Rio Stadium by the coast. Ibere Camargo, for example, is a unique architectural structure built by a famous spanish or portuguese (not sure) architect. Its possible to find exhibitions of famous artists once in every while. Beira Rio is home town of Internacional, the second largest team of the state. It was home of the world cup games when they happened in Porto Alegre.<br> Guaiba Lake is also the greatest spot in town, once there aren't many options to do in Porto Alegre. Therefore, the river is far away the best place to go. Lately a construction to improve the coast is going on. Hopefully in a few years, that coast will be even more attractive and gorgeous.

I had the fortune to stay here in Guaiba for two weeks with a Brazilian family who took me around Guaiba and Porto Alegre. <br><br>To be honest, it is not much to do in in Guaiba, morte to just live a normal Brazilian life. Porto Alegre is better with happenings. Main things to do in Guaiba is to go to restaurants, Ice Cream buffets, cinemas or joyful walks. Still, it is a peaceful and quiet little slumbering town, where compared to many other places in Brazil is feels really safe.

Pontao do Lago Sul is one of those places that have everything you need to spend a nice time with friends or on your own. Over there the visitor can find very good restaurants [not the most affordable ones], great pubs, nice views of the lake, great sunsets, great for daytime and nighttime as well. As the sky is usually clear in Brasilia during the dry season stargazing can be also a great option in the evening.<br>A good option indeed.

Pontão do Lago Sul it the kind of venue that is great to relax observing the lake and the boats that crowd the shore on sunny warm days. Lots of beautiful young people, couples, kids, all roaming around on the lawns or walking up and down the sidewalk.

Oscar Niemeyer designed Brasilia not to have a town centre. Instead, the small satellite cities have a type of central meeting place. The bus station appears to be about the only thing approaching a town centre and would not recommend visiting it unless you are there to catch a bus!! The only place that offers a semblance of a city centre in terms of restaurants is the Pontao do Lago Sul. There are a number of good restaurants here, ATM machines and walks along the lake shore. A word of caution, do not expect to find cheap restaurants here.

It's a very nice place to go, especially if you have children! It is very interactive so everybody gets a go at something. Some of the experiment tools you can see that are getting a bit old, but still all have their charm! Go calmly and set at least a whole afternoon or morning for this program. There is a parking lot at the university that public can use and a bus stop which most buses pass right in front, so it's easy access. Definitely all ages, but will enjoyed more by the kids. P.S.: Wear sneakers and comfy pants, some of the activities require that and hair tied.

This was on the way where I was staying and got really lucky that was in the neighbourhood, so I often passed it and always stopped to look at it. It's a great place to escape to when there's scorching heat outside( it does live up to its name : 'sanctuary') and I think I went at night too. Just sitting in this modern cathedral, bathing in this blue light was an experience in its own right. People book year or two in advance to get married here and I'm not surprised, it is peacefull and celestial, great energy comes out of this place. Brasilia tends to be an open museum so most of the time one wants to be outside to observe this 'Mars-like' city, as Gagarin described it once. But there are interiors that are worth seeing and this is one of them..(visited June 2014 - World Cup time)

Located in the city centre, the Santuario Dom Bosco is another iconic spot that must be seen when you are in Brasilia. The Sanctuary is one of the most famous churches in Brasilia. It is a magical environment where even the most anxious visitor can relax and enjoy the different shades and variations of blue, especially in the afternoon. The sunlight provides special effects, and if you´re lucky enough to be there when the orchestra is playing you´ll have an unforgettable experience. Church services happen during the week and the weekend too. Unmissable.<br>The Sanctuary can be easily reached by public transport.

Passed this Church many times without realizing it was a church. Dom Bosco has of the awe of Basilica but in an completely different way. The size of the building is masked by the marvelous construction techniques, the stained glass walls bring in so much light but tint it with a hue that has an indescribable calming effect. The sound quality of the interior is simply amazing. How the acoustics are perfected to provide such even sound with no echo blew me away.

Santuario Dom Bosco is a bit deceiving from the exterior and looks like a modern block building, but the interior of the main sanctuary is enclosed in blue stained glass creating a gentle blue glow as if you were under water. The 12 ornate entry doors contain bronze plates with images of Dom Bosco with the front entries depicting his utopian dream city (the inspiration for of Brasilia). A huge golden chandelier made of 7,400 pieces of Murano glass dominates the ceiling. The main altar is made of a 10-ton block of marble, and a large Crucifix carved from a single cedar tree hangs above the altar.

TONS to do -- the museum is huge and provided hours of fun. Most displays are in Portuguese, but even non-Portuguese speakers will find plenty to keep kids busy. Our girls are 10 and 8 and really enjoyed themselves -- we went straight to the 3rd floor and checked out all the Physics stuff (which works in any language). Note that you need closed shoes if you want to do the human gyroscope, and you also need to be not-too-tall and not-too-short. My 10-year-old was the right height, but wearing the wrong shoes!!<br>The buffet (upstairs, and called Panoramico Restaurante Executivo) is also amazing, and you can leave the museum after a few hours, have a great lunch, and then go back for more!!

For me it's the most beautiful church, in fact a Sanctuary. A big modern one, with a marvelous chandelier and windows from top to bottom made with various shades of blue stained glasses. Depends on the day light and the hour, you get amazing colors inside. By night, it's beautifully colored by blue shades. It's a most go in Brasilia. Dress properly, it's a place for prayers. Light up a candle and just feel up in Heaven. One of my fav places in Brasilia

The Church of St. Dom Bosco is dedicated to the patron saint of Brasilia who in the mid 1800s, dreamed of a place in central Brazil to start a city. Full length blue stained glass surrounds you on all sides as you enter the sanctuary. An enormous crystal chandelier is above. The peace and beauty of the church are amazing. Definitely worth a visit while in Brasilia.

This building is not that close to Eixo Monumental and so we drove to it and into a small car park next to it with lots of spaces free. The sanctuary is beautiful inside with the blue stained glass giving a blue glow. The church is of course very different to any other church by also being in a square shape (not a 'cross' shape). There are a couple of stairs down that lead to toilets or souvenirs.

The sanctuary honors the Italian saint ""San Giovanni Bosco"" who dreamed of a utopian city in 1883. Brasilia is inspired by this dream. Located in block ""702 Sul"", the sanctuary is easily accessible from the center of Brasilia, near the avenue ""W3 Sul"". A beautiful building to be seen in the late afternoon, when the sun's rays pass through the beautiful stained glass windows. On the left front there is the tabernacle, near where it is advisable to keep silent. Behind the altar there is a beautiful cross 8 meters high with the Christ image, carved in wood. Another curious feature is the chandelier in the center, attached to the ceiling. During the weekdays, wait until about 17:30 hours to view it on. But take the time to take pictures and discover the sanctuary only until 18 hours, when the Mass begins. Remember that it is a sacred place.

We were excited to see the Centre and the current exhibitions. And happy to see on their website that they had a free shuttle service since the Centre is far out of the city center. It would have been very helpful if the Center's website had any information in English but it does not. We relied on Google translate (but honestly such a big cultural center with international exhibition program should have information in English on their website). And the information about the shuttle service should include maps as to where the stops are. In any case, we waited almost 2 hours and no shuttle ever arrived. And now it appears- looking at the Center's facebook page!- that there has been a problem with the shuttle service. Pity they didn't update their website with that vital information!

This is a great place to see in the city, and provides a surreal experience as you walk inside a jewel-box bathed in bluish-purple light.

The church was one of the highlights of a three-hour tour of Brasilia. The whole stop need not take more than 10 minutes, but the overwhelming blue light that fills the room earns the rare distinction of being impossible to capture on camera.

Travelled here on a whim because I'm not a big fan on beaches but heard that this one was different and the bus ticket wasn't expensive. The journey took about two hours and once I got there was hit by the awesome sand dunes and rock faces. Didn't bother to get a guide or anything because it would have been expensive by myself so just walked around by myself, just enjoyed the scenery from different vantage points. The only down point was the large number of groups all walking around together but that's expected in a touristic place. The way back was slightly confusing because I was waiting for the bus in what looked like a bus stop and even had a timetable and after about half an hour a taxi driver took pity on me, and told me the buses hardly stopped there and dropped me off to the bus station for 3 Brazilian Reals when in reality it would have been somewhere around 20. Just shows the generosity of most of the Brazilian people :)

To be honest I was not expecting such a wonderful place although I have read lots of good reviews on Trip Advisor. <br>The best thing to do is to go by the morning and stay there for the day.

Morro Branco is an absolutely stunning place! This is one of the most beautiful places I have visited. If you are in the northeastern part of Brazil, this is a must see. The dune buggy ride makes it even that much more enjoyable. The Canyons have seven different colors of sand. From white to purple to red. Of note many places charge for the bus ride and then you have to pay extra for the dune buggies. The only thing is there is no way to enjoy Morro Branco without riding a dune buggy. Just make sure you know this before hand as it adds to the cost of the trip.

We visited this modern church built in the late 60's on a Sunday afternoon at 1:00 after mass had finished. (Best to avoid during 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. mass). Traffic was almost non existent and there was plenty of places to park within the gates. You pass through impressive carved brass doors with the patron Saint John Dom Bosco's dreams like the "" two columns"" and "" the road to hell."" The colbalt blue stained glass takes your breath away. Immediately you feel simultaneously calm and invigorated. The glass was made in Sao Paolo and chandelier in Murano, Italy. Sit in the pews and enjoy the feeling of being submerged in the deep blue ocean. Before leaving pass by the statue of Italian priest Dom Bosco carved from Italian Carrara marble. The church has hints of European cathedrals with gothic arches, burnished doors and a wooden crucifix but don't come here looking for paintings or religious relics. Visit this church to be awed by glass and light and leave feeling like you glimpsed heaven.

The Cathedral is one of the postcard views of Brasilia. Yet I rate Dom Bosco higher as a place of atmosphere. Despite the traffic noise there is a sense of peace. I visited several times, most memorably a mass after the Haitian earthquake. I recommend including this on any tour of Brasilia.

Another excursion out of Fortaleza to see the incredible sand formations that look like rock in multiple colours. The beach was not as nice as Canoa Quebrada in my mind but long and lovely with caves along the way. The dune buggy sped at blazing speed next to the ocean with the music blaring... Awesome experience! We ate a seafood lunch over looking a part of the beach which was more of a cove that you had to climb over some rocks into a type of inlet to reach the water. The ocean was quite rough that day but warm and refreshing. Beautiful day.

Bigger than the Central Park, this park is very good for a wide variety of outdoor sports, from tennis and sand volley boll to skate, kangoo jumps and bikes. Some tractions are long close, like an wave pool, but there is still a promise that they will be re opened some day. Until den the place has plenty of space for a pic-nik or a barbecue - with some fire places strategically sets -. It also held a Kart track (Carrera), a little Carnival, an area for expositions and eventually musical Shows (just check the city cultural program).

I recommend this as a non religious person. Religious folks can always find a reason to visit a church, but the non observant need more than faith to draw them in.

Morro Branco is one of the most enchanting beaches in Brazil's Northeast. The colorful sandstone cliffs bordering the beach are magnificent. Don't expect much in the way of tourist accommodations here, just a few beach barracas and small pousados for overnight accommodations. However, there are some fine beach houses, many with pools, for rent at very reasonable prices. The beach here is clean, offering miles of wide packed sand, interrupted only by the sound of an occasional dune buggy. Best for those in search of tranquility and solitude in lieu of the party scene.

Parque da Cidade is an excellent park for a stroll, running, cycling, exercising or rollerblading. The tracks are 4Km, 6Km or 10Km long, so you can choose what length to run/cycle/rollerblade.

But as white European, please use a sunblock with 50 at least. Most parts of the tracks are with no single tree or shadow. You will burn yourself terribly.<br>There are water dispenser once in a while or people selling coconuts for drinkin (3R$). You can also use one of the adult playgrounds to work out belly, arms and legs, while your kids are at the amusement park.<br><br>Very recommendable to spend your freetime there.<br><br>There is also a go-cart track and some funny showers. Just put a button and some tiny waterdrops will be dispensed. Feels good at the skin. Just try it out! There are also mango trees fore everyone. Feel free to pick and eat one.

Brasilia is well know for being a city of cars: you get into yours, go where you need to go, mind your business, then get back in the car and drive home. The chronic lack of sidewalks make strolling almost impossible. Thus, there are only two ways to get ""exposed"" to large number of people not leaving or going somewhere: in the shopping amlls or, yes, the City Park (Parque da Cidade).<br><br>The Park is huge and of easy access. Great for running, walking, biking, skateboarding. Grab a coconut and catch your breath watching the geese in the ponds. Spend a few minutes working out at one of the several ""stations"" located alongside the tracks.<br><br>With guards patrolling, the area feels safe. There are public toilets of decent quality. And even a medium-sized amusement park included. All in all a pleasent experience both day and late afternoon/early evenings.

The Santuario Dom Bosco is a beautiful cathedral that does not look particularly special on the outside but the inside is stunning. Floor to ceiling blue tiles on all sides of the entirely open cathedral make a tremendous effect that changes depending on the time of the day as the sun hits different parts of the glass.

Small town, beautiful beach, interesting falajas. Six kilometers of undeveloped beach if you take the gravel road to the left just before descending the hill to Morro Branco. Buggy rides to local attractions, quad rentals, microlight flights, rides on jangadas. Reasonably priced pousadas (small family run hotels). At the far end of the beach you can wade across the Rio Chorro at low tide or take a small man powered ferry to other barracas (beach bars/restaurants). This area is a favourite with kite surfers as well as Brazilian families.

The Parque de Cidade is located near the Western end of the southern hotel zone, convenient to most visitors. There is a walking-jogging-biking-skating path with varying lengths (the maximum is 10 kilometers) that is heavily used by Brasilia residents on weekends.

Parque da Cidade is difficult to get into if you're on foot or biking, which kind of misses the point of a park. There are wide paved roads with no shade, so walking is tough on your knees and can be very hot. There is a run down amusement park at one entrance and some vendors selling coconut water, drinks, and snacks along the way. There is at least one lake, but swimming is prohibited. If you're a tourist, definitely skip this If you live in Brasilia, it might be nice for a bike ride or picnic.

This is one of largest parks I have notice of - considered by city government as largest of its kind in Latin America. Do not expect incredible tree coverage - Brasilia's original vegetation is savannah-like, so many of the trees actually planted aren't native. But if you're looking for a place for a nice, long walk with a friend or family member, this is perfect. <br><br>There are challenges which the government announced it's working on - for example, bathrooms and children's playgrounds which are definitely not well kept. And a wave pool that is totally abandoned. And tennis grounds which, as far as I could see not too long ago, seem to be unplayable. Despite all these, I must commend the layout, the central location, the very nice, large children's playground which was part of my childhood and that of my daughter, too. There even is actually quite a nice amusement park - though I haven't been in a while except as guest to a birthday party, so I didn't have to pay for my daughter to play on toys. Seems prices are a bit too high, but it seems they usually are for amusement parks.<br><br>Last, but not least, my personal pet peeve: if you want to go roller skating/roller blading you cannot go easily around the whole park - the pavement is totally uneven in some areas, while in others it's quite nice. Disappointing!<br><br>And yet, you must absolutely take a walk at least once, if you're in Brasília for any more than 1 day.

This park is great for locals who want to go for a nice walk. You need a car to get here. If you are looking for lots of trees and shade then you will be disappointed as you will not find it here. There are wide paved roads with specific bike lanes but hardly any shade so make sure to bring sunglasses and a hat. There are a few bathrooms along the paths which are not sufficient to support large groups. Near the main entrances there are some vendors who sell coconut water, drinks, and fruit. It is nice in the morning before the sun gets too hot. There are also a few areas with stretching equipment. Again, decent for locals to get some exercise since there are hardly any sidewalks in Brasilia but if you are a tourist then skip this park unless you want to get an idea of what the landscape was like before the city was built.

People from Brasília, old and young, love to jog and cycle in this park, and they crowd available walking and cycling spaces, especially on weekends.<br><br>The thing is, there is not much else to do or see in this giant savanna-like environment.

There is a fake lake, and a few shade trees but, believe me, they don’t help much with the hot temperatures.<br><br>Besides, it’s not taken care of by local authorities; toilets are constantly out of order, there’s no water in water fountains, grass needs mowing where it exists.<br><br>There’s also a weird funfair called Nicolandia, which apparently is part of every local’s childhood memories, and it remains unchanged since they were young.<br><br>I can’t really recommend a visit, but if you insist, don’t forget to take with you a lot of SPF 50 sunscreen.

In fact, there is not much to see, but what you see is just amazingly beautiful - some of the most stunning glass walls you'll witness anywhere. Close to most hotels - a walk away from those on the South side of the hotels sector - and an attraction with absolutely no cost, I think it barely matters what religion one prefers (I, for example, go to the Buddhist temple in town), this is a ""divine"" experience. And you can spend just a brief moment or just relax for a while from running around on some tour.

We walked for a reasonable distance and even though the local maps show where it is the city is so big that the scale on the maps doesn't show it too well.

It is interesting to look at the stained glass up close.This church also adopts a minimalist approach and the confessional stand was a clear glass booth where everyone could see who was in there but the glass thick enough not to hear what was going on.

The theatre itself is quite beautiful in its neoclassical style and luxurious inside; some of the shows and plays enacted there are really catching (and some are really poor, so take care and read a lot of reviews and critiques before buying your ticket). It is really conserved from the years thanks to the organised direction. The theatre's restaurant is also high-standard, but a bit pricy. It is surely worth the while going there if you are spending some days in town, but please be really cautious when arriving, for the park in front of it is dark and dangerous at night (and probably light and dangerous at day).

The arena itself it's a monumental piece of architecture. The gremio store presents an endless range of products. There was no match on when I visited, so the only way to have a look inside was purchasing a tour, pretty dodgy thing to do, as the access to the seats were just steps away. I miss the old days when people could access the Olímpico to take photos without any charge. Great Old times when gremio directors were in charge, not these people that only think about today and not the future of the club or the arena. That's the definition of an amateur administration, boys doing a men's job. Doing the anti marketing as more people would be promoting if it was a free of charge entry. Wake up administrators or just give the job to the ones that are well experienced.

I went with some friends to a game at the end of the season that was crucial for the Championship. The atmosphere was GREAT and people were singing the entire match. The match was totally exciting (although Premio lost...)<br>The Arena is well built and I felt very safe.<br>In the break you can get all kinds of fast food, which could be efficiently obtained (not great, but it was fast food...).<br>Getting out was a bit slow and the traffic was a chaos, but that's Brazil anyway a bit, but usually in a good way....:-).

Although it is a bit far from town, the Arena is amazing! such infrastructure to watch shows and soccer games. The people that attend to the Arena it's very friendly and overall it's very secure to go. But to comeback from the arena, specially at night without a car it's very complicated. Uber it's rare because of the high demand and taxi drivers usually choose the rides, preferring the longest of them. I had to wait almost 2 hours after the event was over and yet walk a good mile before find one taxi driver that accepted my ride (a 10min ride). Sad but overall it was a good experience

We saw Germany vs Algeria here in the World Cup. Don't get me wrong, it was a fantastic experience but we thought the stadium would be a bit nicer. Of the 3 stadiums in Brasil we went to this was bottom of the three (1- Maracana, 2- Mineirao). Pretty accessible but doesn't handle crowds as well as other stadiums, very crowded getting to your seat, etc. Most seats looked like great views though there is about an extra 20-30 yards of space behind each goal which makes you fell like you are farther from the game. Overall a good experience, but not the best that Brazilian soccer has to offer.

This large arena accommodates around 55k attendees. It was recently built and incorporates the quality often seen in top European stadium.

The stadium is excellent and the pitch is close to the crowd so I'd imagine on well attended games the atmosphere would be great.

<br>Porto Alegre is well renowned for it's trees. The Jardim Botânico is however the place to go to see a fantastic collection of trees and shrubs from RS and beyond. Opened in 1958 many of the trees are beginning to reach maturity and offer a shaded walk away from the heat of the city. The gardens are a ten minute ride by taxi and there is a very small entry fee. Shortcomings are that some of the paths are not suitable for the disabled and the associated Natural History museum, though informative has very static displays in cases which are beginning to look rather tired. Otherwise well worth a visit.

It is a renown building from the Portuguese architect Alvaro Siza Vieira. If you like architecture it is totally worth the visit. The exhibits are good too, but the main reason for me was the building. You can go with the Tourist Line Bus that psses by every hour and cross the street trough the underground parking lot . Be careful while waiting for the bus to go back, check if there are people around because it gets lonely and homeless people walk by. I'm not saying that they will actually do something but it is a possibility so better not to take any chances.

Walking through the middle of Curitiba's historic centre, there's no chance of missing the city's cathedral, which dominates Praca Tiradentes. Built in the 1876 in the neo Gothic style, the church features several stained glass windows and paintings by artists such as Italian brothers Carlos and Anacleto Garbaccio. The structure was designed by a French architect who is said to be inspired by Barcelona's Metropolitan Cathedral, another large Gothic place of worship. <br>Just to the left of the cathedral is a great example of Curitiba's Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) system.

This is one of the most interesting parks of Curitiba. There, you can stroll through the alleys and visit the huts Memorial. If you are lucky you may be surprised by the yellow butterfly (local) with the number 88 on the wings. Sign of good luck. In addition, you can visit the shop where are sold pysankas (eggs hand-painted according to the Polish tradition).

Ok, bought a book of tickets for the Tourismo bus. They come in a book of 5 tickets. We only wanted to go here so bought one book. We'd already tried to go but when we were getting off the first time, the conductor told us it wasn't the correct stop. Anyway, it's quite a way on the bus so arrived eventually, get off the bus. Wander over the bridge and you can't get underneath the follow a path or look at it from underneath. The seating area is closed off because there seems to be a conference of some sort. So why aren't you told that this 'attraction' is closed for the day/week? Couldn't even use the loo. What a waste of time and money to get there.

It is one of the main postcards of Curitiba. Opened in 1992, The Wire Opera House was built in tubular structure and transparent polycarbonate roof. The design by architect Dominic Bongestabs, a Brazilian professor of Architecture and Urbanism. It has capacity for 2,400 spectators and a scene of 400m ² for the artistic and cultural presentations.<br>The external environment of the Wire Opera House is also beautiful. It was the place where an old quarry worked. Today, you can enjoy the native forest, a pond with carps, a cascade of 10 meters and several species of birds.<br>A fantastic place.

The foundation has excellent reviews and so we decided to visit while in Porto Alegre for the World Cup. However, we did not use the Linha Turisma bus line (which might have been better to get there - as it is located on the south side of town, a few km from most other attractions) - but took a city bus there. The museum is a little isolated, and walking from the bus station was along a very busy road with little space to walk or cross. However, it is right on the water, and does have pretty views past the stadium toward downtown. The building itself is architecturally interesting, and the layout (with exhibits arranged so you can walk down the ramp from top floor back to lobby) resembles the Guggenheim in New York. Entry was free and staff were sophisticated and helpful (even in English). The exhibits themselves are a little progressive for most people's tastes - dealing mostly with anarchic / anti-establishment works that require interpretation and thought. Nonetheless, if you like modern art and are visiting Porto Alegre, this opportunity is not to be missed.

Visited on June 9th, 2012. I was impressed with the quality of Siza's work, which is very classy yet simple. As another user has said, Siza's architecture makes it worth going there and that was my case, as only the 4th floor was opened on that day as they were still putting an exposition up for the remaining floors. I was initially disappointed with it, but the building and the café next to the main structure made me enjoy the trip to this part of the city. Iberê Camargo's work is quite interesting - I confess I didn't know much about him before visiting the museum. His dark, sad, paitings and very interesting critics of society (as per the letters written by him, which are exposed on the 4th floor) were very nice.

Fundação Iberê Camargo is a must in Porto Alegre, South of Brazil. Projected by the Portuguese star-architect Alvaro Siza, the museum is extremely beautiful.

Unique building in Curitiba but one of maaaany you could see in other, older cities. Since it's so close to historical center - you can take a look, but it's not worth more than a short trip. It's supposed to look a lot better during Christmas time but in other seasons - it's nothing special.

The Ukrainian Memorial in Curitiba is well worth a visit. In a small park alongside Parque Tingui, it contains a replica of a Byzantine-style church with a detached bell tower. There is a small gift shop with a very friendly shopkeeper. Outside the gift shop is a small monument commemorating the Holodomor, the genocide by man-made famine of more than 3 million Ukrainians by the Stalin regime. Inside the church are displays of religious icons and display cases of pessankas, colorfully painted eggs for which the Ukrainians are famous. Near the bell tower is a metal sculpture resembling a pessanka, with a different design on each side.

I agree with most reviewers that wrote before me - it is a small place, but quite worth the visit, mainly if you put it together with a stop at the Oscar Niemeyer museum, which is a very short walk away.

If you are a Catholic, there is the added benefit of the memorabilia connected to the visit of John Paul II, but even if you are not, the cultural aspect of the memorial and the beauty of the woods make this a nice place to visit in Curitiba.

One of the most popular parks in Curitiba.

This is a very very special place, a perfect composition of how humans can design in harmony with, and in celebration of, nature. Located in the centre of Curitiba, on experiencing a visit to this paradise you understand why the city is rightly called by many “the most sustainable city on Earth”.<br><br>Set amongst 37,000m2 of wild and lush native hilly Brazilian forest called Zaninelli woods, an abandoned quarry has been turned into a lush oasis to house UNILIVRE, Brazils first open environmental university. A lesson in urban recycling, the old quarry hole is now a beautiful lake which abounds with wildlife; ducks, turtles, swans, fish, butterflies, dragonflies... The actual school is a lesson in creativity and playfulness; a series of bioconstructed buildings are set on a steep hill within a circular ring of tall Eucalyptus posts, around which spirals a wooden ramp, bringing the adventurer from the lake, around the school up to a viewing platform 22 metres above. While ascending one feels a giddyness and joy like that perhaps of the “Swiss family Robinson”.<br><br>The building was officially opened by Jacque Cousteau on the 5th of June 1992, international day for the environment.

When everybody goes to Curitiba the first thing that comes in their mind is Jardim Botânico (Botanic Garden) but beyond Jardim Botânico, Curitiba has another beautiful attraction called Universidade Livre do Meio Ambiente. The site was created in 1991 and opened in 1992, the main objective is disseminating knowledge and practice environment. Its inauguration had a special participation of Jacques Cousteau, renowned French oceanographer,and who was also known as a strong supporter of environmental causes. Besides being for the practice of good causes, the site is extremely inspiring and magnificent saved by building their union of man and in tune with nature. I consider this place a highlight of Curitiba.

Oscar Riberio de Almeida Niemeyer Soares Filho (wow!, known as Oscar Niemeyer...was a Brazilian architect considered to be one of the key figures in the development of modern architecture....giving modernism a little samba flair! His swirling forms and curving lines replaced European modernism's harshness with softness, as smoooth as Brazilian jazz. His work is sensuous, almost hedonistic. This museum houses many exhibitions from local and overseas artists.

Understandably reviews of this museum often focus on its design. It is strange: a giant eye on a base surrounded by water and behind it, a flat, long, rectangular slab. I'm not sure what the architect, Oscar Niemeyer, was trying to do. Create a museum building that is itself a work of art about looking? Or was it a sly joke: the museum is a place where we look at things, but this museum looks at us?<br><br>But there is a lot more to the museum than its famous exterior. The Curitiba area has a long history of local art and clearly the people who live there care about it. The museum goes all in on modern. One exhibit was a sometimes hilarious expression of the Japanese culture in Brazil. (Brazil has the largest population of ethnic Japanese outside of Japan.) <br><br>At the time I visited, the museum had other exhibits with a much harder edge. One depicted the shock and dehumanizing effects of violence in Brazilian cities, including photos of murders in the favelas. I will remember it for a long time.<br><br>Go see this museum. If your schedule doesn't permit, rearrange it to make time. You'll be glad you did.

Although there are many attributes to be praised in this vast and beautiful park, no one is more important to mention than the cappibaras!!!! Go just to see them! They are wonderful. In addition there is running, walking, skateboarding roller blading etc...all kinds of exercise things to do. There's some places to buy popcorn and drinks. There is lots of birds and fish to see. But really it's all about the cappibaras for me.

One of the main attractions in Curitiba, Parque Barigui if perfect for those who love jogging, walking or reading a book in a beautiful place. It´s always busy, specially on weekends, but you still can enjoy nature and a great view from Curitiba´s buildings. The park has a parking, outside gym and also structure for barbecues. It is easy to get there by car, Uber or bus (bus terminal is close to the park in a walking distance).

10 minutes from downtown, in front of the Barigui Shopping Center, and served by bus from any part of our city. A wonderful lake, a giant business center, miles of walking tracks and lots of parking sites. All for free. Perfect to picnics, jogging, have some sun, biking or only to drink some coconut water. About 20 minutes from Santa Felicidade (Holy Happiness), our famous restaurants area. In winter, a fantastic fog; in summer, thousands of people. Warning: there is no police in the night, wich means robbery and a few violence - when sun downs, everybody goes out.

Whilst travelling on the Linha Turismo bus, we decided to step off at the MON; first of all, because the building is architecturally impressive in the shape of an eye and secondly, because we wanted to escape from the cold as it was 14°c. The entrance tickets cost only R$ 10, with a discount for students and teachers. Inside the museum, we were impressed by the quality of the pieces of art, especially after being left scratching our heads whilst visiting Great Britain's Tate galleries in London and Liverpool. Definitely worth a visit on your trip to Curitiba! We were also delighted to find a sweet local-run restaurant across the road, which served decent quality food at very reasonable prices!

First time a friend Canadian came here he said: I would never imagine that this city could have such beautiful park. It is amazing. That translates Barigui park.

This one time wonderful open space near Champagnat, Batel and Santa Felicidade has fallen onto hard times through neglect. <br><br>There are still the workout enthusiasts that walk and run the sidewalks around the park, but no longer is the condition of the park sufficient for families to feel safe and clean.

We often visit museums in the cities we visit, but we probably would not have sought this one out had we not been taken there by our hosts. <br><br>I can only say, it would have been a missed opportunity. <br><br>Not only did we learn a great deal more about an architect we had heard of, but knew little about, by viewing the extensive and excellent permanent installations of drawings and models of his projects, and photographs of his finished buildings, but we also had the opportunity to view a number of fascinating temporary exhibitions that afforded us a great overview of mid-twentieth century and contemporary Brazilian art, as well as a nice selection of international work. <br><br>Add to that the fact that all of this is housed in one of the architect's most iconic buildings, and the experience becomes even more complete. <br><br>Those of you who go will understand, and have to forgive the play on words, when I say it was a real ""eye opener"".

If you are into culture and want to know the Brazilian's go there, but I do not guarantee that it would have everything written in English (then use the help of the guides). It has a variety of arts and exposition that is world class. Niemeyer is one of the bests architectures of all times and this museum is one of his masterpieces.

I was staying on Padre Anchieta while I was in Curitiba and I loved being able to walk to Barigui Park. It's huge, has walking/running and bike paths that go around the lake in the middle and workout stations on the South Eastern side. We saw tons of people there listening to music, doing scout activities, walking their dogs, playing with some kind of tightrope activity that seemed to be very popular. There's also a museum or station on the North Western side that we didn't get to go in but seemed popular and a number of different local food vendors selling ""screw my diet"" foods on the Western side. On the road that separates the two sections of the park you can also pick up the Linhas Tourismo open double-decker tour bus for a driving tour of all Curitiba's landmarks, parks and attractions. There was a 5k run one Saturday that we were there and several groups from work ran there in the mornings on the weekend. Really great place to spend the day or the whole weekend. Look for the roaming herd of capivara off the northern lake shore too!!

Beautiful art space with interesting exhibitions that seem to cycle through. Even if you're not into Oscar Niemeyer himself, there is still something to see. While we were there, early April 2016, there was a fantastic Japanese/Brazilian art exhibit - and there were English explanations for everything. On the bottom floor, there is some background on Mr. Niemeyer and his work and there is a tunnel that will connect you over to the Eye, where you can take a lift up. Not much to see in the Eye when we were there - no exhibit, and there is no view as the glass is blacked-out. I was most impressed that this museum was so reasonably priced and you can tell real thought was put into making it accessible to everyone. Not sure if this happens every day, but there was also a food truck &amp; fair on the grounds that day, that included a children's play area. My kids did not partake, however, they had fun enough wandering around the museum and the grounds. And if you're into photography, it is lots of fun to catch the angles and light all around the buildings.

This is the most unusual architecture I've ever seen housing a museum. It is known as ""The Eye"" because of it's distinctive shape. There is also a long, rectangular section which has 12 rooms with a different exhibit in each. While there were some I didn't understand at all, there were other pieces that generated much discussion among the friends I was traveling with. In the lower level there is a sculpture garden. There is also a collection of models of the architect's buildings and mural-sized photographs of the same on the lower level. There is a tunnel that leads to ""The Eye,"" and you can climb the stairs or take the elevator up to the top to see the exhibit there. The museum has ramps that go from one area to the next, so visitors with mobility challenges can be accommodated. There is also a cafe where can get sandwiches, soup, salads, and beverages. All the profits from the cafe go into supporting the museum. Security is strict, but all the staff were extremely courteous and helpful. There was an English speaker on duty at the security desk, and we were assigned an English-speaking waiter in the cafe.

Although the name might give that impression, the museum is not just about the work of Oscar Niemeyer. The building is of his hand, which you can recognize by the many curves in the architecture. In the basement of the museum, there is a part that is dedicated to his work, which I found very nice and interesting, and anyone that likes contemporary architecture will agree for sure. For the rest, there are permanent and temporary exhibits. In the eye itself, there was a remarkable collection of art works in a darkened environment, with interesting elements of light and geometry. Our friends (locals from Curitiba) also told that a lot of artwork that was confiscated from corrupt politicians has been added to the museum's collection, but at this moment, it was not exhibited yet, because the authenticity of the artworks still had to be confirmed. Even if the art is not interesting, for sure it will be interesting to see where politicians used the money stolen from the people for... But for that part, we will have to return I suppose!

The park was beautiful, the lake was huge with a walking, jogging and bike track all incorporated which helped with all the traffic there.

This museum can be reached by public transportation and also free and decent parking is available. Before getting yo the museum I was energized by the groups of youths who were rehearsing hip-hop on the surroundings. The building is impressive and very well maintained. Temporary exhibitions were fine but it does not have the weight from the ones that can be visited either in São Paulo or Rio. Highlight to the exposition on the paintings confiscated by Brazilian Federal Police , you will certainly be impressed by the Miró.

Had heard a lot about Oscar Niemeyer from all my Brazilian friends and the museum did live up to the expectations. As I visited Curitiba during the rains, had planned to spend a few extra hours just to avoid the rains. However I ended up spending nearly 4-5 hours inside. The museum is spread on 2-3 floors and is pretty huge. It is really modern and innovative. The halls inside have different collections from various artists and I enjoyed all the paintings that were on display.<br>There are specific sections where illusions are created with lights and other similar attempts. Saw such things for the first time and was really impressed.<br>The tickets were also cheap, there was a coffee and souvenirs shop and a lot of buses are on the route to the museum.

The great thing to live in a city that people love culture is to have museums, theather and places where you can see and enjoy it everywhere. Curitiba is a city like this and Eye Museum (it is how is known here) translate this atmosphere. It is excellent.

You have heard about Central Park, in NYC, right? Well, this is Curitiba's answer to Central Park, a big, sprawling sea of green in a landscape of concrete. When the weather is good, and especially if it falls on a weekend, this park comes alive with people riding bikes, running (Brazilians say ""Fazendo Cooper""), doing excersizes, and simply enjoying the outdoors. There are also a bunch of capyvaras--weird, muskrat looking animals--that hold court close to the lake, where they like to feed on the grass. Rumor had it that a family of crocodiles used to live here too, but that they were caught and moved to a more remote location. In any case, this park, which is located in western Curitiba but well within the metropolitan region, is a blessing of green things and soft grass in an otherwise gray, surrounding urban landscape.

This is the closest thing to Central Park in Curitiba - a big urban park with ponds, bike paths (though you can't find them for rental), dog walking and a little bit of wild life (plenty of ""capivaras"", the biggest rodent in the world). <br><br>This is not the prettiest park on the city in my opinion (""Tanguá"" and ""Universidade Livre do Meio Ambiente"" are) but it's likely the coolest, the largest, the one locals go to the most and the best one for people watching.<br>I don't like this park on Sunday afternoons though - instead of the usual polite, friendly or family oriented crowd, it gets some rather annoying people that don't respect the space of others (loud awful music, littering and so on). Sunday mornings or other days of the week it's great.<br><br>Tropical Banana in the park is a nice place for natural sandwiches and juices.<br><br>The paths inside the forest are known areas for pot smoking and gay cruising - I recommend avoiding those and staying in the main trails unless you're into these.

This is the best park in Curitiba. There are some outsite fitness spaces, developed specially to elder people, but usable by anyone. The cooper lanes are wide (circuits with 2 - 3 miles) and the little lake in the middle of the park makes the air feel softer, less dry than usual. Try to avoid weekend afternoons, when the park is so crowded that will be no parking lots available and cycling becomes almost impossible. Bathrooms are not exactly clean and are closed very often. There are no food but some icecream and coconut water to buy.

We visited Parque Tangua, Jardim Botanica and Parque Barigui, and this was best. Many locals were making use of the park, running, cycling, playing soccer, roller blading or just relaxing. There is a lake in the middle. Views are beautiful. Capybaras, the biggest rodents in the world, except for Uraguayan soccer player) are on the edges of the lake.<br><br>There is a pathway around the lake for cyclists and roller bladers as well as another for runners. The full running track around the lake covers 5.35 Km per lap. I'm sure there are many Strava segments for both the running and cycling tracks. Distances are marked on the running track.<br><br>While we were there, a stall was supplying samples of Brazilian produce, including fair trade coffee, jams and alcohol (Cachaca....including aged cachaca) at the edge of the main carpark. All samples were great; we bought 2 packs of the coffee. Could not buy the alcohol as we will fly from Brazil.

The light exhibition is really fun. Make sure to visit the eye at the top of the building. We arrived at about 5 and nearly missed out on it before the museum closed at 6. I'm really glad we didn't.

I absolutely loved this place. There are three main halls inside the museum. Two of them were dedicated to architecture in Brazil and many had small scale models with them. One room in the back was a walking photo tour of the Soviet Union from the mid 50's through its dissolution in 1991. Amazing work. There were also smaller exhibition rooms around the exterior wall . Unfortunately the one thing I didn't get to see was 'The Eye'. Yes - the giant yellow thing in the picture which is pretty much the key landmark visual for the museum - I didn't have enough time to get in there. So, if you like art museums make sure you allow a couple hours for wandering around this place. It can go by quickly. Also, when we came out the back yard was essentially used as a congregation space for the locals so there was music and popcorn and kids running around. Really great area!

One of the largest parks in Curitiba, with an artificial lagoon, green area and walkside everywhere. You also will find bicycling and running areas, so it's a place to relax and exercise yourself. If you're just walking around, you can sit down and have a beer in the Yellow House pub and enjoy the sunset. Avoid visiting Barigui on Sunday afternoons, unless you like crowded places. Free entrance.

Unilivre is not too big, but it's (along with Tanguá) the prettiest park in Curitiba.<br>You enter through a small path in the woods and get to the view of a lake protected by a tall rock wall. <br>You won't spend too much time here, but it's definitely worthy of a visit

We have a particular interest in Niemeyer as an architect and thus did we want to see his museum on our four-week trip to Brazil. It was definitely worth the detour as it is a spectacular building. The exhibition itself was only so-so and very much oriented towards the technical (and not design-innovative) dimensions of architecture. As such this was a little disappointing.

The concierge at our hotel suggested we visit this park as we were going nearby to see the Opera do Arame. Curitiba apparently has 65 sq meters of green space per inhabitant, and this is a lovely part of that. One of at least 3 quarry sites transformed for public use. At the top it seems like a formal garden--geometric design, garden plants, a curving rather austere though open building. But that overlooks the wonderful park below, with a small lake that feeds into a river. The lake itself is fed by a cascading waterfall. There are barbecue pits, and lots of green space. Worth the visit, with a picnic hamper. There are places to buy food, though.

It's sad the people who live near the park cannot go there... because the park prohibits dogs and the neighbors at least have 2-4 dogs in their houses gated like a fortresses carrying the gold of Ft Knox. <br><br>Anyway, it's huge park. Since skateboarding and rollerblading are prohibited, you will need some serious hiking shoes.<br><br>My friend was sad that the park is never full of people, but <br>1) if the park allows dogs (on a lease) in the park, then the people in the nearby neighbors with the 2-4 dogs can go there and <br>2) if the Opera de Arame was inside the park (like parks in the USA having amphitheaters), <br>Then, Parque Tangua would have traffic and business too.

This is a great museum to visit as it has an eclectic mix of exhibits not just art... there was a mix of architecture, photography (the Salgado Genesis exhibition was exceptional... possibly the best photography exhibition I have ever seen), modern art, local stuff and a little old school art too. We had to hurry a little so i think it would be best to allow at least two hours. It is quite easy to get to on the tube buses too... we just asked in the tourist info (that was harder to find than anything else in Curitiba... it is in the Rua 24 Hours) and they explained how to get there and back :-) i can't recall how much it was to enter but it was a pretty small amount.

I have visited 4 of the Oscar Niermeyer museums in Brasil, Rio, SP, Curitiba, Brasilia. Each one is unique in its own way, from an eye in CTBA to a Starship in RJ. Not only does each prominently display art from all over, each one has displays of local artists as well. A very good mix of the old and the new. Each museum is a photographers dream, from the art to the architecture of the museum itself. While I would recommend this as a day trip, be aware that it may be a bit hard to keep very young children occupied for the time that you will look at all of the exhibits.

Good Evening Every One. First of all i would like to introduce myself here. I am a engineer from India, i visit this park with my girlfriend, she is from Uruguay. We been to the place morning itself we thought its very small so we can finish and move forward to the other places. but it take me hardly 3 hours to enjoy the beautiful park and the lake and the water falls. Its amazing to go there with family and to have fun. In week end the family staying near to the spot coming with their children's and having lunch in the beautiful atmosphere. Good maintenance, having some restaurants in mid of the lake and also in the top of the building. To go to the lake center we have to take the wooden stairs its very nice to go by walk. To reach the other end of the lake we have to go by walk in other direction and go inside a tunnel. It is amazing............

The museum tour will take 2-3 hours if you want to see all the attractions. There are many interesting exhibitions although don't expect world-famous names in this place. There is a very small part of the exhibition dedicated to Oscar Niemeyer, consisting mostly of mock-ups of some of his designs. Most of all, the architecture of The Eye is breath-taking and definitely worth the trip. Also, getting here be sure to take a walk at the Pope's Park, through the Polish Memorial. Since they're just a step a way you can take 15 mins to see them as well.

Not only does MON harbor excellent modernist exhibits, a small overview of its namesakes architectural designs, and a pleasant cafe (plus sparse gift shop), you can't visit the quirky city of Curitiba without seeing the unique and imposing edifice of the Eye. Entry (after walking the grounds) is only Rs 6, and the highlighted exhibits included a retrospective of a famous Brazilian kinetic and chromatic artist, and an overview of the evolution of modern visual, performing, and photographic arts in Brazil. Some really interesting pieces. An enlightening and visually arresting way to pass an hour or two that is more than worth your time. <br><br>PS: you can pass into the Eye itself via a tunnel from the sub-level of the museum. The main atrium within the eye is imposing and housed an impressive exhibit of a renowned local artist.

We are not really into museums - however this was a different thing. The building is worth just going to have a look even if you do not go into the museum! <br><br>The museum is cheap and good to take up an hour or so - but the main reason we went was because i thought you could go inside the eye and see the view. Turns out you can go inside the eye but not see any view - just more museum stuff inside. <br><br>Travel Tip: If you can, see the eye (the building) at dusk and during the day. It looks amazing both times but different both times as well.

This is certainly a ""all afternoon"" program: this great museum presents you with different expositions all year long. But besides that, it's also a city mark: the building is a design by the great brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer. Still, there is a very good café at its hall and a very nice park behind it, where you can have a picnic and relax. Furthermore, there are also many nice cafés and restaurants all around it. And finally, the Bosque do Papa, behind it, presents you with a very nice trip to the 19th century in Poland.

There is quite a number of parcs in Curitiba, each one offering something different. This one has an artificial waterfall, artificial tunnel and quite a few places to ahve a nice picnic or just sit and relax. Personally I admired this one maybe te most. Have a fresh cocoa juice and enjoy a walk around (approx.2km, beware of some climb), feed the fish... I just missed the opportunity to rent a boat to sail through the tunnel, but maybe it was due to low season. Turistic bus (Linha Turismo) is a good way to get here and back.

The park is centered around a pond (lake?) with an artificial waterfall that you can see from the pond level as well as climb the hill and enjoy the view from the structure on top of the rock. The only problem is to get to the park and, even more, back - no way to catch a cab at the park and since it's a good walk from major streets, it's better to have a car or a phone number to order a taxi to the park.

If you go to the top first you will be amazed at the views when you get to the actual monument on the edge of the clifftop. The fountains and grounds are very picturesque and clean and in a nice area easily accessible by road. When you get to the monument and walk up a few stairs you get great views of the waterfall from above, the lake below and the trees and Curitiba below. On the right hand side you can walk down to the lake below and through a cave to get to the bottom of the cliff and the lake and waterfall. <br>Only downside for me is the massive amounts of graffiti on the rocks as you walk through and unfortunately a massive graffiti tag on the monument that you can see from the bottom of the cliff! Hopefully it will be painted over because apart from that it is a very nice place to visit.

It's one of the most interesting spots in Curitiba and in my opinion MUCH better than TripAdvisor's voted #1 (Botanical Garden).<br><br>The museum has Niemeyer all over it - not just the eye, but the patio is also cool to walk around (lots of void spaces under concrete with little support, very Niemeyer-ish). Behind the museum there's a green area where people bring their dogs on weekends, read etc. Nice for people watching.<br><br>Nearby (walking distance) is ""Bosque do Papa"" (a small and nice little part dedicated to pope John Paul the Second). Government buildings are nearby as well.<br><br>As to what the museum displays inside, they are always changing and I have been to really good and really bad ones. It's cheap to get in though (6 reais if you're not eligible for a discount), and 1st Sunday of the month it's always free.<br><br>If you're taking the touristic bus, I recommend making this as one of your stops - it's something different as well given most of Curitiba's attractions are parks.

The artistic creativity of Oscar Niemeyer has to be seen to be believed. With a few seemingly ample pencil strokes he created drawings that became monumental works of art. This museum is an example of that. You will walk beneath unimaginably long concrete beams, and go up and down ramps to see the museum, with the piece de resistance being the olho (eye) that stands suspended on a huge yellow tiled concrete plinth. Don't miss it. Well, you really can't, as it is a stop on the tourist bus line around the city.

The design of this museum was fabulous and was host to several excellent exhibitions inside, As a long time oscar niemeyer fan, this was the first building I had seen of his in person, and it did not disappoint, Some good outdoor sculpures as well. Perhaps my favorite was on the bottom level that had models of some of his other building and also video interviews with him. The interviews portrayed what a visionary and artist this man was.<br><br>It is a bit of a trek but it is walkable from the city center or easy to get to using the hop on hop off bus. <br>Admission was free when I was there, which was on a saturday. The cafe was really busy so took a while to get my food but their selection of fancy coffees was excellent. I had the 4-cheese raviolis which were amazing.<br><br>Overall a great afternoon!

the last architecture piece done by the famous brazilian architecturer. if you want to find out more about his projects, you might be disappointed. this museum is more mike MOMA in New York. This is more dedicated to the art in general. <br><br>you would certainly take you at least 3-4 hours to browse things around. Be there early during the weekend because coming late the afternoon always have a long line up to the entrance. <br><br>The best part of this museum is once you get inside you will walk through from the entrance to the exit with building structures.

I had a morning free so went here to have a look around. It was also ""Social sunday"" (first sunday of each month) which meant the entrance was free. It's a visually impressive building - some very long concrete cantilevers with a number of exhibitions rooms. Overall the place feels quite empty, but it's good as you can walk around very relaxed. The art inside varied from quite bizarre to relative mainstream modern art. I enjoyed it - you can do the whole place easily within 2 hours unless you are a very serious arty person. <br><br>Only minor disappointments were a) no viewing area from inside the ""eye"" (at least I couldn't find it) and b) the shop was very limited - I would have bought some prints/interesting bits of art if available for sale. Really it was just books, t shirts and mugs for sale.

You will find, in a track used since the 17h century, everything we have about nature: cold, rain, sun, warm, fog, trees, rivers, typical food, beach and mountain. Yes, it's not a lie: in one side, Curitiba (3.000 feet over the sea); in the other, beaches. And, if you can take the risk, there are several 'churrasqueiras', the brazilian barbecue grills.

The tourism company caught us at 8am and the executive train departed at 9:15. Sparkling wine and a breakfast tray occupied us during the urban area train ride. Beer, sodas, juices, coffee and latte were available all time long The space is very confortable, with a modern lounge atmosphere, Very efficient and gentle attendant and bilingual guide gave us explanations about historical and geographical aspects. Spectacular view. Photos were allowed, the speed was very slow on purpose, and they even stopped a bit in special points. We arrived late in Morretes, where we got the bus right to the restaurant, to eat a famous local meat stew with banana, and manioc flour. A nice walk around main square in search for souvenirs, local treats as the banana candy, handcrafts and such. Then we took the bus, visited Antonina, with a quick stop for pics and the bus took a long and slow ride at Graciosa stone -paved road, on our way back to Curitiba. The contact with the abundant remains of Atlantic forrest is also a highlight of the tour.

Plan to visit this fascinating museum, it may take anything between 1.5-3 hrs. Admission is BRL 6 (free first Sunday of every month). Entrance is in the ground floor; go first to the first floor to find contemporary art exposition of several artists. Next go to the underground which is mainly dedicated to Oscar Neimeyer; there is also a gallery of a Brazilian photographer (probably from the XIX Century). From the underground take a curved tunnel that leads to the tower (the building looking like an ""eye""). You might take the elevator to the last floor where is the main exposition hall. In the way down take the stairs and either exit in the second floor using a long ramp or continue all the way down to return to the main building; in every floor find pictures of the museum constructions supervised by Neimeyer himself. Accessible ramps and elevators, 2 free parking lots, coffee and gift shop.

If you find yourself in Curitiba, it is well worth the short 45-minute drive to Morretes along the Estrada da Graciosa.

Like all other constuctions built from Oscar Niemeyer, the best known brazilian architect, it is a worth seeing building. Because the admission fee is very low you should go inside. Even you are not interested in art, the visitation will be worthwhile for you. I cannot predict what kind of art you will be awaited from, because there are frequently new exhibitions. The most exiting feature of the museum ist he tower where the „eye“ is resting. You will find it going through a tunnel of light.

Leaving Curitiba you can reach Morretes and Antonina, beautiful small towns, by the Graciosa road.

Morretes is in the middle of the Serra do Mar and Antonina is in the Antonina Bay. Both are surrounded by mountains and the Atlantic Forest. You will have a lovely day trip, driving in the morning, eating pastel on the Graciosa road, walking and eating barreado (a meat plate of this region) in Morretes and/or Antonina.

Niemeyer's most emblematic oeuvre in south Brazil, the ""eye"" is truly a sight to behold. As you take the main ramp over an expanse of water and under the massive white slab that is the museum per se, you really get taken in by the purity of the architect's vision. Funnily enough, the actual construction is a bit rough up close. The museum has a wide variety of permanent exhibitions and frequently changing visiting ones.

Graciosa Road is a very beautiful, scenic road that goes all the way down from Curitiba to Morretes and Antonina, almost on the shore. One can go much faster through te new road, but it can't be compared to the scenery of Graciosa Road. If you are in Curitiba and has never done that, it's a ""must"".

The building itself is already an attraction. It was designed by the famous Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer. It's called either ""MON"" or "" The Eye Museum"" (Museu do Olho). There is a R$4,00 fee to enter the museum to see the exhibitions (2011 fee).<br>It is located at a calm neighborhood, has two big parking lots (although these parking lots can be full specially during the sunny weekends). <br>There are 3 places (restaurant bar) very close where you can sit to have food and drinks. Inside the museum complex there is a cafe as well (but I really prefer the bars in front of the museum to eat while I appreciate the wonderful view).<br>There is a park on the backside of the MON complex where people take their dogs every Saturday. In this same park we can see one of the Curitiba Rugby teams doing their training.<br>If you don't have time to go there during the weekend, then try to go at night during business days.<br>It's worth every moment spent there.

I am a little prejudiced because Curitiba is really a second home to me. In all honesty, there is not all that much to do there and the city isn't perched on the edge of a beautiful sea or ocean. Curitiba is a quiet place compared to Sao Paulo and Rio and generally very friendly and orderly. If you spend a couple of days there on your way to somewhere else, well that's just fine. They have a nice double-decker buss that will take you around to all the sites.<br><br>Whatever you do though make sure to try and spend a few hours in the truly great Museu Oscar Miemeyer. It is, in my humble opinion, one of the best museums I have ever been to. There are always 5 or 6 new exhibits going on and the people of Curitiba have spent a lot of bucks to ensure that they are well curated. Most of the info will be in Portuguese, but that's really not a problem as it's the art and how it is presented that's important.<br><br>Leave time to go up into the ""eye"" of the museum and don't miss the exhibit of the incredible buildings designed by Brazil's 101 year old National Treasure, Oscar Niemeyer.

Not a highway for sure! :-) Very slow drive - windy, narrow, cobblestone road to the historic town of Morretes. You wouldn't take this road to get anywhere fast, that's for sure.

From Curitiba you can go to the city of Morretes by the Estrada da Graciosa (Graciosa Road). It is a ancient road that crosses the mountains near the coast inside the astounding rain forest or ""Mata Atlântica"". The best way is by car, but you can see more adventurous people riding bikes... There are many different stops with wonderful sightsees. The road runs also besides the Nhundiaquara River, in some steps it is possible to swim, but the water is cold. It´s also possible to try “bóia cross”, or to roll down the river in large rubber buoys. Near to the arrival of the bóia cross, there is a very small town, Porto de Cima, with a very old church (somebody told me it was built by the Portugueses!). There is a restaurant there (Dona Ciroba) and a place with ginger ice creams (I loved!). At the end of the road you can enjoy the little town of Morretes with their typical restaurants, which main dish is ""Barreado"", cooked beef with manioc flavour (tasty!). If you drink alcohol, try the typical ""cachaça"" from the region, with banana flavor and even other local fruits mixtures.

What to say about this road? I was grown up travelling every weekend with my parents to the coast and making our stops there for the snack.

Get a complete package with Estrada Graciosa. If driving from Curitiba first thing to find is the stone portal marking the beginning of the road. Enjoy the exuberant tropical mountain vegetation. There is first a climb up in normal paved road, get to the top then start going down in cobblestone paved road (probably not very good for people sensitive to bumpy/shaky roads). There are several spots for parking with restaurants offering tasty pasteis (wheat dough fried empanada) stuffed with meat, cheese, shrimps and siri (crab-like small crustacean), prices ranging from 4 to 8 BRL. Try the coconut water for 4.5 BRL. For a more hearthy lunch drive to the point where PR-410 intersects Rod. Mario Marcondes Lobo (route to Morretes). In this area there 4-5 restaurants offering the famous Barreado (beef cooked for over 20 hrs) fried fish and shrimps and Churrascarias as well. Few kilometers down the road in direction to Morretes find spots where it is possible swim in the river (at your own risk), probably the better and safer will that one next to the bridge over Rio Nhundiaquara. From there continue to Morretes (see reviews for Morretes)

I was a bit disappointed after walking here from our hotel. This is billed as the historic part of the city. It's obvious that it's old, but it's a pretty small area defined by some old buildings whose facades are being preserved while the interiors are converted for other uses.

This Sunday morning faire (similar to any Flea Market in California) is a great place to stroll around and spend 3-4 hours easily. Lots of beautiful and handcrafted craft items to decorate the home or office, small trinkets, jewellery, pottery, clothes, eatables. As any faire would attract, there are also road-side performers and a few annoying people moving around. Shop keepers are very friendly and most shops accept credit cards which is great for the tourist. The prices are very affordable and the shop keepers are eager to get your sale, so a mild bargaining is possible (5-10%). Sugarcane juice shops are a few in and around, it was good when I had a glass from one of these shops. I bought a couple of linen draw string pants, very good quality and nice fabric. I would easily agree that a visit to Curitiba is not complete without a trip to the Feira do Largo da Ordem!

Santa Felicidade is a place to and eat. ""Galeterias"", places offering a fix menu centered around chicken, polenta and pasta are quite common in Southern Brazil and Santa Felicidade is full of them in many different sizes, models and prices. If in Curitiba, is it worthed going there mainly if you like this kind of meal or if you never went there before. Service and food are ""mass produced"" and usually lacks in quality, mainly in week-end when places are flooded with people.
