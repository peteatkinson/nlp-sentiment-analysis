# TripAdvisor Sentiment Analysis


> Rundown


Decided to watch a few tutorials online on sentiment analysis as I've had an interest in it for a while now. Followed a brief tutorial on how to extract sentiment from Amazon reviews and decided to do the same with TripAdvisor ones.
I'm using NLTK and SKLearn to build up the model and train it to get the classification rate. A simple tokenizer is involved to build up tokens for extracting the words, and removing those that are classified as stop words.
It's a pretty simple model, but I'm still learning.
